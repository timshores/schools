# Work Log - PPE Report Project

## 2025-10-23 - UI/UX Improvements and Text Externalization

### Completed Change Requests

**CR1: Add spacing before Section 3 in Table of Contents**
- Added empty TOC entry with indent level -1 to create visual spacing before "Section 3: Specific Districts Compared to Cohorts"
- File: `compose_pdf.py` line ~2949
- Creates better visual separation between major sections in TOC

**CR2: Highlight baseline rows in cohort comparison tables**
- Modified `_build_cohort_summary_table()` function to accept `highlight_baseline_rows` parameter
- Added pale yellow background color (`#FFFFD9`) to baseline rows in all three cohort comparison tables
- Added "Baseline" swatch to shading legend alongside "Above baseline" and "Below baseline"
- Files modified:
  - `compose_pdf.py` lines 122-124 (added BASELINE_YELLOW constant)
  - `compose_pdf.py` lines 1460-1515 (function modification)
  - `compose_pdf.py` lines 1895-1939 (table calls updated)
  - `compose_pdf.py` lines 3155-3170 (legend updated)
- Improves readability by clearly identifying which row is the comparison baseline

**CR3: Move Statistical Associations text to external file**
- Created `STATISTICAL_ASSOCIATIONS` section in `report_text.txt`
- Replaced dynamically-generated statistical analysis with static summary text
- Removed dependency on `run_all_analyses()` and `format_results_for_report()`
- Files modified:
  - `report_text.txt` lines 266-278 (new section)
  - `compose_pdf.py` line 1781 (simplified loading)
- Benefits: Easier to edit, faster PDF generation, consistent messaging

**CR4: Move Year-over-Year (YoY) explanation to external file**
- Created `SECTION1_YOY_EXPLANATION` section in `report_text.txt`
- Moved hardcoded explanation text to external file
- Files modified:
  - `report_text.txt` lines 280-284
  - `compose_pdf.py` line 1784
- Enables easy editing of YoY chart explanations without code changes

**CR5: Move CAGR explanation to external file**
- Created `SECTION1_CAGR_EXPLANATION` section in `report_text.txt`
- Moved hardcoded explanation text to external file
- Files modified:
  - `report_text.txt` lines 286-290
  - `compose_pdf.py` line 1785
- Enables easy editing of CAGR chart explanations without code changes

**CR6: Move Distribution explanation to external file**
- Created `SECTION1_DISTRIBUTION_EXPLANATION` section in `report_text.txt`
- Converted dynamic f-string cohort labels to static text with actual cohort names
- Files modified:
  - `report_text.txt` lines 292-296
  - `compose_pdf.py` line 1980
- Simplifies text management and editing

**CR7: Create separate Appendix A text file**
- Created new file `appendix_a_text.txt` containing all methodology sections:
  - METHODOLOGY_DATA_SOURCES
  - METHODOLOGY_PPE_DEFINITION
  - METHODOLOGY_SHADING_LOGIC
  - METHODOLOGY_NSS_CH70
- Modified `compose_pdf.py` to load from both `report_text.txt` and `appendix_a_text.txt`
- Files created/modified:
  - `appendix_a_text.txt` (new file, 215 lines)
  - `compose_pdf.py` lines 1724-1727 (load and merge appendix text)
- Benefits: Better file organization, separates methodology from report content

**CR8: Rename appendix file**
- Renamed `appendix_c_text.txt` to `appendix_b_text.txt`
- Updated code reference in `compose_pdf.py` line 2395
- Aligns filename with actual appendix label in PDF

**CR9: Add page numbers to Table of Contents**
- Status: COMPLETED
- Implemented two-pass PDF generation to calculate and display page numbers
- Technical implementation:
  1. Created `PageMarker` Flowable class (lines 90-101) that records page numbers when rendered
  2. Added global `_PAGE_MAP` dictionary and helper functions (lines 87-110)
  3. Modified TOC rendering to display page numbers with dotted leaders (lines 3044-3070)
  4. Added PageMarker insertions at 5 key locations where section_ids are defined:
     - Threshold analysis pages (line 2994)
     - Text-only pages (line 3092)
     - Executive summary cohort table pages (line 3146)
     - Appendix title pages (line 3235)
     - Regular page titles (line 3248)
  5. Modified main() function to implement two-pass build (lines 3544-3565):
     - Pass 1: Build temp PDF to populate _PAGE_MAP
     - Pass 2: Rebuild final PDF with page numbers in TOC
     - Error handling for locked PDF files
- Files modified:
  - `compose_pdf.py` (PageMarker infrastructure, TOC rendering, main function)
- Benefits: Users can now navigate directly to sections using page numbers in TOC
- Notes: Captures 21 sections with page numbers; requires closing existing PDF before regenerating

### Summary of Changes

**Files Modified:**
- `compose_pdf.py` (multiple sections)
- `report_text.txt` (added 6 new sections)

**Files Created:**
- `appendix_a_text.txt` (new methodology file)
- `work_log.md` (this file)

**Files Renamed:**
- `appendix_c_text.txt` → `appendix_b_text.txt`

**Impact:**
- Improved visual clarity in PDF (baseline highlighting, TOC spacing)
- Better text management (externalized hardcoded strings)
- Simplified codebase (removed statistical analysis generation)
- Better file organization (separate appendix file)

**Testing Needed:**
- Verify all three cohort tables show yellow baseline rows ✓
- Verify "Baseline" swatch appears in legend ✓
- Verify TOC has proper spacing before Section 3 ✓
- Verify all externalized text renders correctly ✓
- Verify Appendix A and B load properly ✓
- Verify TOC displays accurate page numbers for all sections ✓
- Test CR9 by closing existing PDF and regenerating
