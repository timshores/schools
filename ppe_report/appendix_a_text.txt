• Required Net School Spending (rqdnss2): Minimum spending required by state law
• Actual Net School Spending (actualNSS): Total district spending on education
• Foundation Enrollment (distfoundenro): District foundation enrollment used for Ch70 funding calculations

METHODOLOGY_PPE_DEFINITION
================================================================================

<b>2. Per-Pupil Expenditure (PPE) Definition</b>

Per-pupil expenditure (PPE) is reported in the End of Year Report (EOYR) for municipal and regional districts, and is calculated by in-district FTE.

Per the DESE's Researcher's Guide, section XV. Using financial data:
<i>"The out-of-district total cannot be properly reported as a per-pupil expenditure because the cost of tuitions varies greatly depending on the reason for going out of district."</i>

<b>3. Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)</b>

CAGR measures the mean annual growth rate over a specified time period, assuming constant growth.

<b>Formula:</b> CAGR = (End_Value / Start_Value)^(1 / Years) − 1

<b>Example:</b> If expenditures grow from $10,000 to $12,000 over 5 years:
CAGR = ($12,000 / $10,000)^(1/5) − 1 = 1.2^0.2 − 1 = 0.0371 = 3.71% per year

Note: CAGR requires positive values at both endpoints and is undefined if data is missing.

<b>3a. Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth Rate</b>

YoY growth rate measures the percentage change from one year to the next, providing insight into annual fluctuations.

<b>Formula:</b> YoY Growth = (Value_year / Value_previous_year − 1) × 100

<b>Example:</b> If expenditures increase from $10,000 (Year 1) to $10,500 (Year 2):
YoY Growth = ($10,500 / $10,000 − 1) × 100 = 5.0%

If expenditures then increase to $11,000 (Year 3):
YoY Growth = ($11,000 / $10,500 − 1) × 100 = 4.76%

<b>Key differences from CAGR:</b>
• YoY shows year-to-year changes; CAGR smooths growth over multiple years
• YoY captures annual volatility; CAGR assumes constant growth
• YoY is useful for identifying specific years with unusual growth patterns

<b>4. Enrollment-Based Cohorts</b>

Districts are grouped by total in-district FTE enrollment into five cohorts (based on IQR analysis) for meaningful peer comparison:

{COHORT_TINY_INFO}

{COHORT_SMALL_INFO}

{COHORT_MEDIUM_INFO}

{COHORT_LARGE_INFO}

{COHORT_SPRINGFIELD_INFO}

<b>Weighted EPP Formula (for aggregate calculations):</b>
For each category and year: Weighted_EPP = Σ(District_EPP × District_In-District_FTE) / Σ(District_In-District_FTE)

<b>Example:</b> District A spends $5,000/pupil (500 students), District B spends $6,000/pupil (300 students)
Weighted average = ($5,000×500 + $6,000×300) / (500+300) = $5,375/pupil

<b>Enrollment Calculation:</b> For each series (In-District FTE, Out-of-District FTE) and year: Sum across all member districts in the enrollment group.

METHODOLOGY_SHADING_LOGIC
================================================================================

<b>5. Orange/Blue Shading Logic (District Comparison Tables)</b>

District pages include tables comparing each district's per-pupil expenditures (PPE) and growth rates (CAGR) to their enrollment-based peer group aggregate (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, or Springfield).

<b>Two independent tests determine shading:</b>

<b>Test 1 - Dollar Amount (2024 $/pupil column):</b>
Compares the district's 2024 PPE to the baseline's 2024 PPE using relative difference: (District − Baseline) / Baseline
• <b>Orange shading:</b> District spending is ≥{DOLLAR_THRESHOLD_PERCENT}% higher than baseline
• <b>Blue shading:</b> District spending is ≥{DOLLAR_THRESHOLD_PERCENT}% lower than baseline
• <b>No shading:</b> Difference is less than {DOLLAR_THRESHOLD_PERCENT}%

<b>Test 2 - CAGR (5y, 10y, 15y columns):</b>
Compares the district's CAGR to the baseline's CAGR using absolute percentage point difference: District_CAGR − Baseline_CAGR
• <b>Orange shading:</b> District CAGR is ≥{CAGR_THRESHOLD_PP} percentage points higher than baseline
• <b>Blue shading:</b> District CAGR is ≥{CAGR_THRESHOLD_PP} percentage points lower than baseline
• <b>No shading:</b> Difference is less than {CAGR_THRESHOLD_PP} percentage points

<b>Shading Intensity:</b> Both metrics use graduated shading where darker colors indicate larger differences:
• PPE/Enrollment bins: {DOLLAR_BIN_1}% (lightest), {DOLLAR_BIN_2}%, {DOLLAR_BIN_3}%, {DOLLAR_BIN_4}%+ (darkest)
• CAGR bins: {CAGR_BIN_1}pp (lightest), {CAGR_BIN_2}pp, {CAGR_BIN_3}pp, {CAGR_BIN_4}pp+ (darkest)

<b>Key insight:</b> The tests are independent. An orange 2024 $/pupil with unshaded CAGRs typically means:
• The district started at a higher baseline 15 years ago, AND
• The district has been growing at roughly the same rate as peers
• Therefore it remains higher in absolute dollars but isn't growing faster

<b>Statistical Rationale:</b> The 5%/1pp thresholds were selected through analysis of variation across all Western MA districts. See the Threshold Analysis page for detailed methodology and alternative scenarios considered.

METHODOLOGY_NSS_CH70
================================================================================

<b>6. Chapter 70 Aid and Net School Spending (NSS) Calculations</b>

Chapter 70 is Massachusetts' primary state aid program for K-12 education. Net School Spending (NSS) is the total amount a district spends on education from local and state sources.

<b>Data Sources:</b>
• <b>Chapter 70 Aid (c70aid):</b> State aid received by the district (DESE profile_DataC70 sheet)
• <b>Required NSS (rqdnss2):</b> Minimum spending required by state law, adjusted (DESE profile_DataC70 sheet)
• <b>Actual NSS (actualNSS):</b> Total district spending on education (DESE profile_DataC70 sheet)

<b>Important Note:</b>
NSS/Ch70 values are reported in <b>absolute dollars</b>, NOT per-pupil. Unlike PPE (which divides by in-district FTE), NSS/Ch70 values represent total district funding amounts.

<b>Stacked Components (bottom to top in plots):</b>
1. <b>Ch70 Aid ($):</b> c70aid
   • Green bar in plots • State funding received by district

2. <b>Req NSS (adj) ($):</b> max(0, rqdnss2 − c70aid)
   • Amber bar in plots • Required local contribution (after subtracting Ch70)
   • Uses max(0, ...) to handle rare cases where Ch70 > Required NSS

3. <b>Actual NSS (adj) ($):</b> actualNSS − rqdnss2
   • Purple bar in plots • Spending above minimum requirement
   • Represents discretionary local spending beyond state mandates

<b>Total NSS ($):</b> Sum of all three components = actualNSS

<b>Example Calculation (Amherst, FY2024):</b>
• Ch70 Aid: $6,791,000
• Required NSS: $18,859,000; Req NSS (adj): $18,859,000 − $6,791,000 = $12,068,000
• Actual NSS: $31,511,000; Actual NSS (adj): $31,511,000 − $18,859,000 = $12,652,000
• Total NSS: $6,791,000 + $12,068,000 + $12,652,000 = $31,511,000

<b>Aggregate Calculation (Weighted Per-District Average):</b>
For aggregate enrollment groups (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Outliers):
1. Convert each district's absolute dollars to per-pupil values
2. Compute enrollment-weighted average per-pupil across all member districts
3. Multiply by average enrollment per district to get weighted avg $ per district

This methodology produces per-district values that are weighted by enrollment size, enabling fair comparison across different-sized district aggregates.

<b>Important:</b> Only districts with valid PPE (per-pupil expenditure) data are included in NSS/Ch70 aggregates to ensure data quality and consistency across all analyses.

<b>Shading:</b>
NSS/Ch70 comparison tables use the same orange/blue shading logic as PPE tables (5% dollar threshold, 1pp CAGR threshold).
