# Work Log - School Data Analysis Project

## Workflow Instructions for Claude Code

**Script Execution Policy:**
- Do not run scripts (`compose_pdf.py`, `western_map.py`, `nss_ch70_main.py`, etc.) unless needed for testing purposes
- User will run scripts from separate terminal to save token usage
- User has VS Code open and may not see file updates automatically - files need to be reloaded in editor to see changes

**Text Formatting in ReportLab (compose_pdf.py):**
- ReportLab `Paragraph` objects require HTML/XML markup, not Python escape sequences
- Use `<br/>` for line breaks (not `\n`)
- Use `&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;` or HTML tags for indentation (not `\t`)
- Supports: `<b>` for bold, `<i>` for italic, etc.

## 2025-10-06 - Choropleth Map and Windows Filename Fix

### Choropleth Map of Western MA Districts

**Added geographic visualization** showing district locations color-coded by enrollment cohort.

**Implementation:**

1. **Created `western_map.py` module** for choropleth generation:
   - Loads Census Bureau TIGER/Line shapefiles (unified, elementary, secondary school districts)
   - Matches Western MA traditional districts to geometries using cleaned name matching
   - Color codes by 5 enrollment cohorts (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Springfield)
   - Highlights 5 districts of interest with dark orange outlines
   - Generates static 300 DPI PNG for PDF inclusion

2. **Color Palette (colorblind-friendly):**
   - Tiny: Purple (#9C27B0)
   - Small: Green (#4CAF50)
   - Medium: Blue (#2196F3)
   - Large: Orange (#FF9800)
   - Springfield: Red (#F44336)
   - Districts of interest outline: Dark Orange (#FF8C00)

3. **Data Source:**
   - US Census Bureau TIGER/Line 2023 shapefiles for Massachusetts
   - Three district types: unified (212), elementary (63), secondary (29)
   - Combined total: 304 district geometries
   - Successfully matched: 58 out of 61 Western MA districts
   - Unmatched: 3 districts (Farmington River Reg, Greater Commonwealth Virtual, Hoosac Valley Regional)

4. **Integration Points:**
   - Added to Section 1 of PDF report (after PPE overview, before enrollment analysis)
   - Auto-generated by `district_expend_pp_stack.py` during plot generation
   - Graceful fallback if geopandas not installed
   - Output: `output/western_ma_choropleth.png`

5. **Files Created/Modified:**
   - **NEW: `western_map.py`** - Choropleth generation module (350+ lines)
   - **NEW: `data/shapefiles/`** - Copied Census shapefiles from nss_web_app_py
   - **MODIFIED: `compose_pdf.py`** - Added choropleth page to Section 1 with explanatory text
   - **MODIFIED: `district_expend_pp_stack.py`** - Integrated map generation into build process
   - **MODIFIED: `requirements.txt`** - Added geopandas>=0.14, reportlab>=4.0

**Update: Improved Rendering for Overlapping District Boundaries**

6. **Layered rendering to handle overlapping districts:**
   - **Problem:** Elementary and regional secondary districts overlap geographically
   - **Solution:** Two-layer rendering with **spatially-adaptive** diagonal stripe pattern
     - Layer 1: Non-regional districts (elementary/unified) with solid filled polygons (85% opacity)
     - Layer 2: Regional districts with stripe color that adapts spatially based on what's underneath
   - **Implementation:**
     - Added `is_regional` flag based on district name and shapefile type
     - Separate rendering for 54 non-regional (solid) and 4 regional (striped)
     - **Spatially-adaptive stripe coloring** using geometric intersection analysis:
       - For each regional district, compute `geometry.intersection()` with every underlying elementary district
       - Create separate geometry for same-cohort overlaps and different-cohort overlaps
       - Plot same-cohort overlap areas with **white stripes** (for contrast)
       - Plot different-cohort overlap areas with **cohort-color stripes** (for identification)
       - Example: Frontier (green/Small) shows white stripes over green elementary, green stripes over purple elementary
     - Stripe pattern: `facecolor="none"` with `hatch="////"` creates alternating transparent/color stripes
     - Transparent areas allow underlying elementary district fills to show through completely
   - **Regional districts identified:** 4 total with spatial analysis results:
     - **Frontier** (Small/Green): 7 different-cohort areas (green stripes) + 4 same-cohort areas (white stripes)
     - **Ralph C Mahar** (Small/Green): 9 different-cohort areas (green stripes) + 3 same-cohort areas (white stripes)
     - **Amherst-Pelham** (Medium/Blue): 9 different-cohort areas (blue stripes) + 2 same-cohort areas (white stripes)
     - **Southwick-Tolland-Granville** (Medium/Blue): 3 different-cohort areas (blue stripes) + 0 same-cohort areas

7. **Enhanced legend:**
   - Separate entries for solid vs striped districts within each cohort
   - Cohort-colored stripe samples for regional districts
   - White stripe sample showing alternative pattern for same-cohort overlaps
   - Clearer visual hierarchy with explanatory labels

**Impact:**
- ✅ Visual context for Western MA geography
- ✅ Immediate understanding of which districts are included/excluded
- ✅ Cohort distribution visible geographically
- ✅ Overlapping district boundaries properly handled with spatially-adaptive diagonal stripes
- ✅ Regional vs non-regional districts visually distinguished
- ✅ Spatially-adaptive stripe coloring provides maximum visual clarity
- ✅ White stripes provide contrast where regional overlaps same-cohort elementary
- ✅ Cohort-colored stripes show regional's cohort where it overlaps different cohorts
- ✅ Stripe pattern adapts within each regional district based on geometric overlaps
- ✅ Transparent/color alternating stripes show underlying geography clearly
- ✅ Both district types visible simultaneously without obscuring each other
- ✅ Stripe pattern more visible and clearer than dashed outlines or solid hatching
- ✅ Spatial analysis reveals detailed overlap patterns (e.g., Frontier: 7 different-cohort + 4 same-cohort areas)
- ✅ Professional cartographic visualization suitable for reports
- ✅ Sophisticated use of geometric operations (intersection, unary_union) for intelligent rendering

### Windows Reserved Filename Fix (nul file issue)

**Problem:** Code was creating `output\nul` file, which is a Windows reserved device name causing git issues.

**Root Cause:** Filename generation used manual string replacement without checking for Windows reserved names (CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1-9, LPT1-9).

**Solution:**

1. **Created centralized `make_safe_filename()` function** in `school_shared.py` (lines 24-72):
   - Handles all Windows reserved device names
   - Converts special characters (≤, ≥, >, <, etc.) to safe alternatives
   - Removes/replaces problematic characters (/, \, :, *, ?, ", |)
   - Prefixes reserved names with "file_" (e.g., "nul" → "file_nul")
   - Removes non-ASCII characters

2. **Updated all filename generation code:**
   - `nss_ch70_main.py` - NSS/Ch70 plot filenames
   - `compose_pdf.py` - District PNG path functions
   - `district_expend_pp_stack.py` - PPE plot filenames

**Files Modified:**
- `school_shared.py` - Added make_safe_filename() function
- `nss_ch70_main.py` - Use safe filename function
- `compose_pdf.py` - Use safe filename function
- `district_expend_pp_stack.py` - Use safe filename function

**Impact:**
- ✅ No more Windows reserved device name files
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Git can properly track all output files
- ✅ Prevents OS-level file system issues

## 2025-10-06 - Final Formatting Polish and Consistency Updates

### Comprehensive Formatting and Labeling Refinement (8-Point Update)

**Change A: Enrollment Axis Spacing and K/M Abbreviations**
- **Spacing improvements** (district_expend_pp_stack.py:167-169, nss_ch70_plots.py:153-166):
  - Increased `pad=12` on y-axis tick labels (space between enrollment numbers and donut dots)
  - Increased `labelpad=15` on y-axis label (prevents "Enrollment" text from overlapping donut dots)
- **K/M abbreviations** for enrollment axis (matching dollar axis style):
  - Created `enrollment_formatter()` function in both plot_one_simple() and plot_one()
  - Format logic: ≥1M shows "X.XM", ≥1K shows "X.XK", <1K shows integer
  - Applied to all PPE plots (district_expend_pp_stack.py:172-183, 316-327) and NSS/Ch70 plots (nss_ch70_plots.py:156-165)
  - Examples: "1.5K" instead of "1500", "2.3M" instead of "2,300,000"
- **Impact:** Cleaner axis formatting, no overlap between enrollment labels and donut ticks

**Change B: Fixed Extra Donut Dot on Springfield Plot**
- **Problem:** Springfield plot showed extra donut dot above labeled ticks (probably at 35,000 with no label)
- **Root cause:** Matplotlib auto-adding tick beyond data range without assigning label
- **Solution** (district_expend_pp_stack.py:233-237, nss_ch70_plots.py:213-217):
  - Check if tick label exists and is non-empty before rendering donut
  - Only render donut if `label_text and label_text.strip()`
- **Impact:** No more floating donuts above the y-axis on any plots

**Change C: K/M Abbreviations Applied to Enrollment Axis (Duplicate of A)**
- See Change A above - this was the implementation of the K/M abbreviation formatter

**Change D: Scatterplot Formatting with $ Signs and K/M Abbreviations**
- **Added custom formatters** (western_enrollment_plots_individual.py:156-176):
  - `enrollment_formatter()`: K/M abbreviations for x-axis (enrollment)
  - `ppe_formatter()`: $ signs + K/M abbreviations for y-axis (PPE)
  - Examples: "$45.0K" instead of "45000", "1.5K" instead of "1500"
- **Applied to scatterplot axes:**
  - X-axis (enrollment): Shows "1.0K", "2.0K" quartile markers
  - Y-axis (PPE): Shows "$15.0K", "$20.0K", "$45.0K" values
- **Impact:** Scatterplot matches formatting style of all other plots

**Change E: Scatterplot Table Enhancements**
- **Sort arrow indicator** (compose_pdf.py:224, 229):
  - Added ▼ to "2024 PPE" column header: `<b>2024<br/>PPE ▼</b>`
  - Shows table is sorted by 2024 PPE descending (highest to lowest)
- **Cohort dividing lines** (compose_pdf.py:232-276, 306-310):
  - Track cohort changes in both left and right columns during row building
  - Store row indices where cohort transitions occur (TINY→SMALL→MEDIUM→LARGE)
  - Add faint gray lines (0.3pt, colors.grey) above each transition row
  - Applied to both left column (cols 0-3) and right column (cols 5-8) independently
- **Impact:** Table visually groups districts by enrollment cohort, clear sort direction

**Change F: Updated Weighted Average Subtitles**
- **Changed subtitle** (compose_pdf.py:1195):
  - OLD: "PPE vs Enrollment — Not including charters and vocationals"
  - NEW: "PPE vs Enrollment — Weighted average per district"
- **Rationale:** More accurate description of aggregate calculation method
- **Applies to:** All Western MA cohort aggregate plots (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large)

**Change G: Updated Weighted Average Y-Axis Labels**
- **PPE plots y-axis** (district_expend_pp_stack.py:167-171, 312-316):
  - Added dynamic label selection based on enrollment_label
  - If enrollment_label contains "weighted avg": ylabel = "Weighted avg $ per pupil"
  - Otherwise: ylabel = "$ per pupil"
  - Applied to both plot_one_simple() and plot_one()
- **NSS/Ch70 plots y-axis** (nss_ch70_plots.py:127):
  - Changed from "Weighted Avg $ per District" to "Weighted avg $ per district"
  - Changed from "$ per District" to "$ per district"
  - Lowercase for consistency with other labels
- **Impact:** Y-axis labels clearly indicate when values are weighted averages vs individual districts

**Change H: Updated Enrollment Axis Labels**
- **Enrollment label standardization** (district_expend_pp_stack.py:754, nss_ch70_main.py:152,157,162,167):
  - OLD: "Enrollment per District (weighted avg)"
  - NEW: "Weighted avg enrollment per district"
  - Applied to all Western MA cohort aggregates (Tiny, Small, Medium, Large)
- **Dollar axis label standardization** (see Change G):
  - OLD: "Weighted Avg $ per District"
  - NEW: "Weighted avg $ per district"
- **Consistency:** All "weighted avg" labels now use lowercase and consistent word order

### Files Modified
- **western_enrollment_plots_individual.py** (lines 156-176):
  - Added enrollment_formatter() and ppe_formatter() for scatterplot axes
  - Applied K/M abbreviations and $ signs to scatterplot

- **district_expend_pp_stack.py** (multiple locations):
  - Added enrollment_formatter() to plot_one_simple() (lines 172-183)
  - Added enrollment_formatter() to plot_one() (lines 316-327)
  - Added dynamic ylabel selection for weighted avg (lines 167-171, 312-316)
  - Increased spacing: pad=12, labelpad=15 (lines 167-169, 313-315)
  - Fixed extra donut dot check (lines 233-237)
  - Updated enrollment label to "Weighted avg enrollment per district" (line 754)

- **nss_ch70_plots.py** (multiple locations):
  - Added enrollment_formatter() function (lines 156-165)
  - Increased spacing: pad=12, labelpad=15 (lines 153, 166)
  - Fixed extra donut dot check (lines 213-217)
  - Updated ylabel to lowercase (line 127)

- **nss_ch70_main.py** (lines 152,157,162,167):
  - Updated enrollment label to "Weighted avg enrollment per district"

- **compose_pdf.py** (multiple locations):
  - Added sort arrow ▼ to scatterplot table headers (lines 224, 229)
  - Added cohort change tracking and dividing lines (lines 232-276, 306-310)
  - Updated subtitle to "Weighted average per district" (line 1195)

### Impact Summary

## 2025-10-06 - Planned Next Steps

### Objective: Add Regional CPI Comparison and Geographic Visualization

**1. Regional CPI Data Integration**
- **Data source:** Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) CPI-U data for Boston-Cambridge-Newton metro area
  - Boston CPI is standard reference for Massachusetts cost-of-living adjustments
  - May also want Northeast region CPI or National CPI for additional context
- **Time period:** 2009-2024 (matching current plot timeframe)
- **Integration points:**
  - Add CPI adjustment option to expenditure plots (inflation-adjusted dollars)
  - Show real vs nominal growth rates in CAGR tables
  - Compare district spending growth to CPI growth (outpacing inflation vs falling behind)
- **Implementation considerations:**
  - Need to decide: adjust historical values to 2024 dollars, or show CPI as overlay line?
  - May need new column in tables: "Real CAGR (CPI-adjusted)"
  - Could add toggle in plot generation: nominal vs real dollars
- **Data location:**
  - Store in new CSV: `data/cpi_boston_metro.csv` or similar
  - Add BLS API integration option for automatic updates

**2. Choropleth Map of Included Districts**
- **Purpose:** Show which Western MA districts are included in analysis at a glance
- **Map requirements:**
  - Massachusetts state outline
  - Western MA county boundaries (Berkshire, Franklin, Hampshire, Hampden)
  - District boundaries or town polygons
  - Color coding:
    - Highlight 5 districts of interest (Amherst-Pelham, Amherst, Leverett, Pelham, Shutesbury) in dark orange
    - Show all other Western MA Traditional districts in steel blue
    - Gray out excluded districts (charters, vocational, non-Western)
  - Cohort indicators: Could use different shades/patterns for Tiny/Small/Medium/Large cohorts
- **Technical approach:**
  - Use geopandas + matplotlib for static map generation
  - Data source: MassGIS (MA Office of Geographic Information) provides district/town shapefiles
  - Alternative: Use Folium for interactive HTML map (could be separate from PDF)
- **Integration:**
  - Add as new page early in PDF (before Section 1 or after TOC)
  - Title: "Western Massachusetts Traditional School Districts Included in Analysis"
  - Could include legend showing cohort boundaries and district counts
- **File structure:**
  - New script: `western_map.py` for map generation
  - Shapefile data in: `data/ma_districts/` directory
  - Output: `output/western_ma_map.png`

**3. Additional Enhancements to Consider**
- **CPI comparison page:**
  - Dedicated page showing CPI trend line 2009-2024
  - Table comparing district/cohort CAGR to CPI growth rate
  - Districts with spending growth < CPI highlighted (losing purchasing power)
- **Real vs Nominal toggle:**
  - Add parameter to all plotting functions: `inflation_adjusted=False`
  - When True: multiply historical values by CPI ratio to convert to 2024 dollars
  - Update y-axis labels: "$ per pupil (2024 dollars)" vs "$ per pupil (nominal)"
- **Map enhancements:**
  - Add district enrollment size as circle overlays
  - Show PPE by color gradient (expensive districts darker, cheaper lighter)
  - Include major highways/cities for geographic orientation

**4. Data Files Needed**
- CPI data CSV with columns: year, cpi_value, cpi_index_2024base
- MA district shapefile (.shp, .shx, .dbf, .prj) from MassGIS
- District-to-town mapping (some districts span multiple towns)

**5. New Dependencies**
- `geopandas` for spatial data handling
- `shapely` for geometry operations (comes with geopandas)
- `descartes` or `contextily` for basemap backgrounds (optional)

### Questions to Resolve
1. CPI reference: Boston metro only, or also show Northeast/National for comparison?
2. Inflation adjustment: Convert all to real dollars, or keep nominal with CPI overlay?
3. Map style: Simple choropleth, or add enrollment/PPE overlays?
4. Map placement: Before Section 1, after TOC, or in new "Geography" appendix?
5. Interactive map: HTML version in addition to static PDF image?

### Nul
The code created the file output\nul which causes problems with git. 'nul' is a reserved name in Windows. 
Instructions for Claude Code during next session: Update the code to make sure it does not create a nul file.
Tell Daisy why it was created in the first place, if known.

## 2025-10-05 - Cohort System Refinement and Plot Improvements

### Implemented 5-Tier IQR-Based Cohort System

**Change 1: Updated Cohort Boundaries from 4-tier to 5-tier**
- **Old system (4 tiers):**
  - Small: 0 to Median (rounded to nearest 100)
  - Medium: Median+1 to Q3 (rounded to nearest 100)
  - Large: Q3+1 to max non-outlier (rounded to nearest 100)
  - Springfield: >8000 FTE (outlier)

- **New system (5 tiers):**
  - Tiny: 0 to Q1 (rounded to nearest 100)
  - Small: Q1+1 to Median (rounded to nearest 100)
  - Medium: Median+1 to Q3 (rounded to nearest 100)
  - Large: Q3+1 to max non-outlier (rounded **up** to nearest 1000)
  - Springfield: >8000 FTE (outlier)

**Implementation:**
- `school_shared.py:87-97` - Updated `calculate_cohort_boundaries()` to calculate Q1, Median, Q3
  - Added `round_up_1000()` function for Large cohort upper bound (ensures districts like Chicopee (7,530 FTE) are correctly classified)
  - Updated static fallback definitions to include TINY
- `school_shared.py:243-246` - Updated `get_western_cohort_districts()` to return 5 cohorts
- `school_shared.py:670-695` - Updated `prepare_western_epp_lines()` to handle "tiny" bucket
- `school_shared.py:577-587` - Updated `context_for_western()` to include TINY mapping
- `compose_pdf.py:203-208` - Added purple color (#9C27B0) for TINY in scatterplot table
- `compose_pdf.py:326-328` - Updated scatterplot table sort order to place TINY first
- `compose_pdf.py:1230-1248` - Added western_tiny list and TINY grouping logic
- `compose_pdf.py:1274-1281` - Added TINY to bucket_map for district baselines
- `compose_pdf.py:1323-1330` - Added TINY to group_map for NSS/Ch70 baselines
- `compose_pdf.py:1417-1442` - Added TINY to Appendix B methodology text
- `compose_pdf.py:1466-1481` - Updated methodology to describe 5 cohorts instead of 4
- `nss_ch70_main.py:74-79` - Added western_tiny to enrollment_groups
- `nss_ch70_main.py:126-127` - Added "Tiny" filename handling for NSS/Ch70 plots
- `western_enrollment_plots_individual.py:130-150` - Added TINY cohort (purple) to scatterplot
- `western_enrollment_plots_individual.py:160-206` - Updated enrollment grouping plot to show 5 bars with narrower width (height=0.64)

**Change 2: Improved Plot Overflow Tick Logic**
- **Problem:** Faded overflow ticks appeared on all plots, even when recent enrollment stayed within cohort bounds
- **Solution:** Only extend y-axis with faded ticks when **early years (2009-2011)** exceed the cohort upper bound
- **Implementation:**
  - `nss_ch70_plots.py:151-187` - Check early years enrollment before extending axis
    - If early max > cohort bound: extend by 100-200 above early max
    - Tick spacing: 100 (if ylim < 1000), 200 (if ylim ≤ 2000), 500 (if ylim < 5000), 1000 (otherwise)
  - `district_expend_pp_stack.py:173-201, 254-282` - Same logic for PPE plots (both plot_one_simple and plot_one)
- **Examples:**
  - Amherst (Medium, ylim=1800): Shows 0-1800 with 200 spacing, faded 2000 tick if 2009 enrollment > 1800
  - Leverett (Tiny, ylim=200): Shows 0-200 with 100 spacing, no overflow ticks if 2009 ≤ 200

**Change 3: Removed Top Border from All Plots**
- `nss_ch70_plots.py:147` - Added `axL.spines['top'].set_visible(False)`
- `district_expend_pp_stack.py:202, 283` - Added same to both plot functions

**Files Modified:**
- `school_shared.py` - 5-tier cohort calculation, TINY handling throughout
- `compose_pdf.py` - TINY cohort in all mappings, tables, methodology
- `nss_ch70_main.py` - TINY aggregate plot generation
- `nss_ch70_plots.py` - Early-years overflow logic, top border removal
- `district_expend_pp_stack.py` - Early-years overflow logic, top border removal, tick spacing fix
- `western_enrollment_plots_individual.py` - 5-tier scatterplot and grouping plot

**Impact:**
- ✅ Better granularity for small districts (Tiny cohort separates smallest 25%)
- ✅ Large cohort upper bound now accommodates high-enrollment districts correctly
- ✅ Scatterplot table shows all 5 cohorts with color-coded dots
- ✅ Y-axis overflow ticks only appear when historically necessary
- ✅ Tick marks properly align with cohort boundaries (e.g., 1800 for Medium)
- ✅ All titles and labels automatically reflect dynamic IQR-based boundaries
- ✅ Cleaner plot appearance without top border

**Cascade Verification:**
- [x] Enrollment grouping plot shows 5 bars with correct boundaries
- [x] Scatterplot shows 5 colors (purple, green, blue, orange for cohorts)
- [x] All Western MA aggregate pages generated for 5 cohorts
- [x] District comparison baselines automatically use correct cohort
- [x] Appendix B methodology lists 5 cohorts with member districts
- [x] No legacy ">500 Students" or "≤500 Students" text remains

### Moved ALPS PK-12 NSS/Ch70 Page Back to District Section with Baseline Shading

**Change:** Moved ALPS PK-12 Chapter 70 Aid and Net School Spending page from Appendix A back to the district section (after ALPS district pages), and added baseline comparison shading.

**Implementation** (`compose_pdf.py` lines 1184-1212):
- Removed ALPS PK-12 NSS/Ch70 from Appendix A section
- Added after ALPS PK-12 district pages (following ALPS Peers comparison)
- Computes ALPS Peers baseline for comparison
- Adds red/green shading to show how ALPS PK-12 compares to ALPS Peers aggregate
- Title: "ALPS PK-12: Chapter 70 Aid and Net School Spending (vs ALPS Peers)"

**Files Modified:**
- `compose_pdf.py` - Moved ALPS PK-12 NSS/Ch70 page, added baseline shading
- Regenerated PDF (7.8 MB, 12:57)

---

### Added 2025 Data to Aggregates Using 2024 Enrollment Proxy

**Issue:** Aggregate NSS/Ch70 plots showed 2009-2024 while individual districts showed 2009-2025, causing the 2025 column in district comparison tables to have no red/green shading.

**Root Cause:** Enrollment data only available through 2024, but C70 data includes 2025. Previous code dropped 2025 for aggregates.

**Solution:** For years with missing enrollment (like 2025), use the most recent available enrollment as a proxy.

**Implementation** (`school_shared.py` lines 698-712):
```python
# For each district with missing enrollment for a year:
# 1. Find most recent available enrollment
# 2. Use that value as proxy for missing year
# This allows 2025 C70 data to be included using 2024 enrollment
```

**Verification:**
- Western MA >500: Now includes 2025 (~$224.8M per district)
- ALPS Peers: Now includes 2025
- ALPS PK-12: Now includes 2025
- Individual district comparison tables: 2025 column now has red/green shading vs aggregates

**Files Modified:**
- `school_shared.py` - Added enrollment forward-fill logic
- Regenerated all plots and PDF (7.8 MB, 12:40)

---

### FINAL FIX: Changed to Weighted Avg Per District (Not Per Pupil)

**Clarification:** The aggregates should use **weighted average per DISTRICT**, not per pupil.

**New Calculation:**
1. For each district/year: Compute per-pupil values (dollars / enrollment)
2. Compute enrollment-weighted average per-pupil across all districts
3. Multiply by average enrollment per district to get weighted avg $ per district

**Formula:**
```
weighted_avg_pp = sum(district_pp * district_enrollment) / sum(district_enrollment)
weighted_avg_per_district = weighted_avg_pp * mean(district_enrollment)
```

**Changes Made:**

1. **Rewrote `prepare_aggregate_nss_ch70_weighted()`** (`school_shared.py` lines 690-732):
   - Merges C70 data with enrollment by district/year
   - Computes per-pupil for each district
   - Calculates enrollment-weighted average per-pupil
   - Multiplies by average enrollment to get weighted avg $ per district
   - Added `include_groups=False` to fix pandas FutureWarning

2. **Updated All Labels** to "Weighted Avg $ per District":
   - **nss_ch70_plots.py** line 113: Y-axis label
   - **compose_pdf.py** lines 1227, 1288, 1308: Subtitles

**Verification:**
- Western MA >500: Shows ~$33M-$58M per district (2024)
- Values represent what an average district in the aggregate spends
- Weighted by enrollment so larger districts have more influence

**Files Modified:**
- `school_shared.py` - Complete rewrite of weighted aggregate calculation
- `nss_ch70_plots.py` - Updated y-axis label
- `compose_pdf.py` - Updated subtitles
- Regenerated all plots and PDF (7.8 MB, 12:26)

---

### CRITICAL FIX: NSS/Ch70 Data Alignment and Total Row Shading

**Issues Found:**
1. **2025 data showing 745 million instead of ~$17K per pupil** - enrollment data ended at 2024 but C70 data included 2025
2. **Total row not shaded in comparison tables** - baseline map didn't include "Total"
3. **Labels said "$ per pupil" instead of "Weighted Avg"** - misleading for aggregates
4. **Only one bar showing for 2025 on aggregate plots** - division by zero/NaN issue

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Fixed `prepare_aggregate_nss_ch70_weighted()`** (`school_shared.py` lines 693-699):
   - Now drops years where enrollment data is missing
   - Prevents division by zero or NaN
   - Ensures consistent per-pupil calculations across all years
   - Before: 2025 showed $745M (undivided absolute dollars)
   - After: 2025 is dropped (no enrollment data available)

2. **Added Total to Baseline Maps** (`compose_pdf.py` lines 691-702):
   - `_build_nss_ch70_baseline_map()` now computes Total row baseline
   - Sums all components to get total series
   - Computes CAGR and dollar values for Total
   - Enables red/green shading on Total row

3. **Updated Labels to "Weighted Avg $ per Pupil"**:
   - **nss_ch70_plots.py** line 113: Y-axis label
   - **compose_pdf.py** lines 1214, 1275, 1295: Subtitles for all aggregates

**Verification:**
- Western MA >500: Now shows bars for 2009-2024 (not 2025), values $8K-$16K per pupil
- Total row shading: Now works in comparison tables
- Labels: Clearly indicate "Weighted Avg $ per Pupil" for aggregates

**Files Modified:**
- `school_shared.py` - Fixed enrollment alignment in weighted aggregate function
- `compose_pdf.py` - Added Total to baseline maps, updated subtitles
- `nss_ch70_plots.py` - Updated y-axis label
- Regenerated all plots and PDF (7.7 MB)

---

### Major NSS/Ch70 Enhancements - Weighted Per-Pupil Aggregates (Earlier Session)

**Changes Made:**

1. **Created Weighted Per-Pupil Aggregate Function** (`school_shared.py` lines 632-707):
   - Added `prepare_aggregate_nss_ch70_weighted()` function
   - Computes enrollment-weighted per-pupil NSS/Ch70 values for aggregates
   - Formula: weighted_avg = sum(dollars) / sum(enrollment) for each year/component
   - Enables proper comparison between different-sized aggregates

2. **Updated All Aggregate Calls to Use Weighted Version**:
   - **compose_pdf.py**: Changed 5 locations to use `prepare_aggregate_nss_ch70_weighted()`:
     - Western MA baselines for district comparisons (lines 1011, 1019)
     - Western MA aggregate pages in Appendix A (line 1168)
     - ALPS Peers aggregate page in Appendix A (line 1230)
     - ALPS PK-12 aggregate page (line 1250)
   - **nss_ch70_main.py**: Updated 4 aggregate calls (lines 76, 83, 92, 100)

3. **Moved ALPS PK-12 to Appendix A** (`compose_pdf.py`):
   - Removed ALPS PK-12 NSS/Ch70 page from district section (line 1133)
   - Added to Appendix A with other aggregates (lines 1248-1266)
   - Ensures all aggregates are grouped together

4. **Added raw_nss Data for Aggregates** (`compose_pdf.py`):
   - Western MA aggregates now store raw_nss for Appendix B tables (line 1184)
   - ALPS Peers stores raw_nss (line 1245)
   - ALPS PK-12 stores raw_nss (line 1265)

5. **Fixed Total Row Shading** (`compose_pdf.py` lines 550-586):
   - Added shading logic for Total row in NSS/Ch70 comparison tables
   - Shades start dollar (col 2), latest dollar (col 6), and all CAGR columns (cols 3-5)
   - Uses same red/green shading rules as component rows

6. **Limited NSS/Ch70 Plots to 2009-2025** (`nss_ch70_plots.py` lines 79-85):
   - Plots now filter to 2009-2025 timeframe
   - Tables remain at 2010-2025 per existing logic in Appendix B

7. **Updated Plot Y-Axis Labels** (`nss_ch70_plots.py`):
   - Added `per_pupil` parameter to `plot_nss_ch70()` function (line 59)
   - Aggregates display "$ per pupil" label
   - Individual districts display "Dollars ($)" label
   - **nss_ch70_main.py** detects aggregates and sets flag (lines 132-133)

8. **Updated Subtitles for Per-Pupil Aggregates** (`compose_pdf.py`):
   - Western MA aggregates: "Funding components (per pupil)" (line 1176)
   - ALPS Peers: "Funding components (per pupil)" (line 1237)
   - ALPS PK-12: "Funding components (per pupil)" (line 1257)
   - Individual districts keep original subtitle without "(per pupil)"

**Impact:**
- ✅ Western MA aggregates now show weighted per-pupil values (comparable across size groups)
- ✅ ALPS Peers and ALPS PK-12 show weighted per-pupil values (proper comparison)
- ✅ Individual districts show absolute dollars (appropriate for single entities)
- ✅ Total row now has proper red/green shading in comparison tables
- ✅ All aggregates grouped together in Appendix A
- ✅ NSS/Ch70 data tables available for all aggregates in Appendix B
- ✅ Plot labels correctly indicate per-pupil vs absolute dollars

**Files Modified:**
- `school_shared.py` - Added weighted per-pupil aggregate function
- `compose_pdf.py` - Updated all aggregate calls, moved ALPS PK-12, fixed Total shading, added raw_nss
- `nss_ch70_main.py` - Updated to use weighted aggregates, detect aggregate vs district
- `nss_ch70_plots.py` - Added per_pupil parameter, limited date range to 2009-2025
- Regenerated all NSS/Ch70 plots and PDF

### Fixed NSS/Ch70 Plots to Display Absolute Dollars (Earlier Session)

**Issue:** NSS/Ch70 plots were displaying values in the $13K-$24K range instead of millions, making it appear they were per-pupil values despite code claiming absolute dollars.

**Root Cause:**
- Data preparation functions (`prepare_district_nss_ch70`, `prepare_aggregate_nss_ch70`) were correctly returning absolute dollar values from profile_DataC70 sheet
- However, `nss_ch70_main.py` was computing a single global y-axis limit across ALL districts using `compute_nss_ylim()`
- This caused small districts (e.g., Shutesbury with ~$2.6M total NSS) to have invisible bars when plotted on the same scale as large aggregates (e.g., Western MA >500 with ~$300M+)
- The result was a blank plot with an inappropriate y-axis scale (0 to 1.6 billion)

**Fix Applied:**

1. **nss_ch70_main.py** (lines 115-118, 137):
   - Removed global y-limit computation with `compute_nss_ylim()`
   - Changed `right_ylim=None` to enable matplotlib auto-scaling for each plot individually
   - Updated console output to reflect auto-scaling approach

2. **nss_ch70_plots.py**:
   - Updated module docstring (line 9): Changed "per-pupil basis" to "absolute dollars (not per-pupil)"
   - Updated `plot_nss_ch70()` docstring (line 72): Changed "per-pupil" to "absolute dollars (not per-pupil)"
   - Deprecated `compute_nss_ylim()` function (line 147): Added note that it's deprecated for absolute dollar plots due to wide variance in district sizes

**Verification:**
- Shutesbury 2024 values now correctly display:
  - Ch70 Aid (green): $645,986
  - Req NSS (adj) (amber): $820,401
  - Actual NSS (adj) (purple): $1,159,959
  - **Total: $2,626,346** (matches source data exactly)
- Plot y-axis appropriately ranges from $0 to ~$3.2M (auto-scaled to Shutesbury's size)
- All three stacked components are now visible and correctly proportioned

**Files Modified:**
- `nss_ch70_main.py` - Removed global y-limit, enabled auto-scaling
- `nss_ch70_plots.py` - Updated documentation, deprecated `compute_nss_ylim()`
- Regenerated all NSS/Ch70 plots in `output/` directory
- Regenerated `output/expenditures_series.pdf` with corrected plots

## 2025-09-29 - Session Start

### Project Context
- Python scripts for analyzing MA school district expenditure data
- Migrated from ChatGPT web interface to Claude Code in VS Code
- Core files working together:

- Implementation needed in: `compose_pdf.py`

### Implementation Plan
1. ✅ Read compose_pdf.py and district_expend_pp_stack.py
2. ✅ Add data table formatting functions for:
   - Category expenditure per pupil data (epp_pivot DataFrames)
   - FTE enrollment data (lines dictionaries)
3. ✅ Create new appendix section ("Appendix B: Data Tables")
4. ✅ Format tables to show:
   - District/region name
   - All years of data (columns)
   - Categories/enrollment types (rows)
   - Values in readable format

### Changes Made (Session 2)
**Issue 1: Fixed table width overflow in Appendix B**
- Modified `_build_epp_data_table()` to accept doc_width parameter
- Modified `_build_fte_data_table()` to accept doc_width parameter
- Tables now dynamically calculate column widths to fit page width
- Changed table padding and font sizes to accommodate more columns

**Issue 2 & 3: Added calculation methodology and district membership lists**
- Added new "Calculation Methodology" page (Page 2) showing:
  - ALPS PK-12 aggregate calculation: weighted EPP formula with example
  - Member districts for ALPS PK-12: Amherst, Amherst-Pelham, Leverett, Pelham, Shutesbury
  - PK-12 District Aggregate calculation and 10 member districts
  - All Western MA Traditional Districts (≤500) with full member list
  - All Western MA Traditional Districts (>500) with full member list
- Formula shown: Weighted_EPP = Σ(District_EPP × District_In-District_FTE) / Σ(District_In-District_FTE)
- Enrollment calculation: Simple sum across all member districts

### Changes Made (Session 1)
- Added two new functions to compose_pdf.py:
  - `_build_epp_data_table()`: Creates tables showing expenditure per pupil by category across all years
  - `_build_fte_data_table()`: Creates tables showing FTE enrollment data across all years
- Modified `build_page_dicts()` to:
  - Store raw data (raw_epp, raw_lines) in page dictionaries
  - Add "Appendix B: Data Tables" section after Appendix A
  - Create data table pages for each district/region
- Modified `build_pdf()` to handle "data_table" page type
- Result: PDF now includes complete data tables for all districts and regions at the end

### Changes Made (Session 3)
**Issue 1: Move methodology to Appendix C and add CAGR**
- Moved "Calculation Methodology" from Page 2 to Appendix C (after data tables)
- Added detailed CAGR explanation with formula: CAGR = (End/Start)^(1/Years) − 1
- Added example: $10,000 → $12,000 over 5 years = 3.71% CAGR

**Issue 2: Fix data table font wrapping**
- Created new style `style_data_cell` with fontSize=7, leading=9
- Applied to all data cells in EPP and FTE tables in Appendix B
- Maintains readability while preventing line wrapping

**Issue 3-5: Improve first page comparative plot**
- Removed enrollment subplot (microplots) entirely
- Increased BAR_WIDTH from 0.58 to 0.75 (30% wider)
- Reduced SPACING_FACTOR from 1.35 to 0.95 (tighter spacing)
- Added enrollment change annotations directly on bars:
  - Shows absolute change (e.g., "+150" or "-50")
  - Shows percentage change (e.g., "+5.2%" or "-3.1%")
  - Color coded: blue for increases, red for decreases
  - Displayed in bordered boxes above each bar
- Reduced figure height from 14.0 to 10.0 (removed subplot space)
- Updated legend to remove enrollment microplot reference
- Added subtitle text explaining enrollment annotations

### Changes Made (Session 4 - Major Restructuring)
**Issue 1: Fixed data table word-wrapping**
- Reduced data cell font to fontSize=6, leading=8
- Reduced header font to fontSize=7, leading=9
- All values now fit on single lines without wrapping

**Issue 2-3: Consolidated appendix intro pages**
- Appendix A intro now on same page as first Western MA chart
- Appendix B intro now on same page as first data table
- Removed standalone intro pages, saving 2 pages

**Issue 4-7: Improved first page comparative plot**
- Moved legend from bottom to top (loc="upper center")
- Increased enrollment annotation font from 10 to 12
- Increased note font from 13 to 14
- Changed crimson color from #DC2626 to #B91C1C (deeper crimson)
- Note text now matches crimson color
- Adjusted layout: top=0.92, bottom=0.08

**Issue 8-9: BIG CHANGE - Two pages per district**
- Created new `plot_one_simple()` function for solid-color PPE plots
- Each district now has TWO pages:
  1. **Simple version**: Solid indigo color (#4F46E5), no category breakdown, no tables
  2. **Detailed version**: Category stacks with tables (original format)
- Title distinguishes them: "...(Detailed)" added to second page
- Applies to: ALPS PK-12, Amherst-Pelham, Amherst, Leverett, Pelham, Shutesbury
- Doubled plot generation: 6 districts × 2 versions = 12 plots
- Gives readers quick overview first, then detailed breakdown

### Test Results
✅ PDF generates successfully (4.7MB - larger due to double pages)
✅ Tables fit within page width without wrapping
✅ Methodology page shows all formulas and district lists
✅ Appendix A consolidated with first chart
✅ Appendix B consolidated with first data table
✅ Appendix C shows CAGR calculation with examples
✅ First page plot: legend above, larger fonts, crimson color
✅ All districts have both simple and detailed pages
✅ Simple plots use solid indigo color
✅ 27 PNG files generated (15 district plots, 2 Western plots, 1 comparative)

### Data Structures Identified
- **epp_pivot**: pd.DataFrame with years as index, spending categories as columns, $/pupil as values
- **lines**: Dict[str, pd.Series] with enrollment series (In-District FTE, Out-of-District FTE)
- Each page dict already contains cat_rows, cat_total, fte_rows with aggregated data

### Changes Made (Session 5 - Layout and Spacing Improvements)
**Issue 1: Fixed Appendix C pagination**
- Split methodology content into two separate pages to avoid footer overlap
- Page 1: CAGR definition and Aggregate District Calculations (37 lines)
- Page 2: Red/Green Shading Logic (23 lines)
- Each page stays well above the 5-line buffer before footer boundary

**Issue 2: Improved Page 1 (Western overview) layout**
- Increased figure height from 10.0 to 13.0 inches for more breathing room
- Increased x-axis tick label font from 18 to 22
- Increased y-axis label font from 24 to 26
- Increased legend font from 20 to 22

- Legend repositioned from bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 1.00) to (0.5, 0.97)
- Plot is now much taller and less cramped

**Issue 3: Fixed Page 2 (ALPS & Peers) legend/annotation overlap**
- Increased annotation spacing from 2% to 3% of y-axis max (PPE_PEERS_YMAX = 35000)
- Moved enrollment explainer text from y=0.995 to y=0.985
- Moved legend from bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 0.98) to (0.5, 0.96)
- Adjusted subplot top margin from 0.92 to 0.88
- Creates more vertical space between bars/annotations and legend/text
- Prevents overlap of enrollment rectangles with legend

### Changes Made (Session 6 - Horizontal Bar Chart Redesign)
**Issue 1: Fixed Appendix C footer overlap with KeepInFrame**
- Implemented `KeepInFrame` wrapper for methodology text blocks in compose_pdf.py
- Calculates available height: page height - 1.5 inch buffer (title/subtitle/footer)
- Uses mode='shrink' to automatically resize content if needed
- Prevents text from overlapping footer regardless of content length
- Future-proof solution: adding more methodology content won't cause overlap

**Issue 2: Redesigned Page 1 Western overview to horizontal bars**
- **Complete 90° rotation**: Changed from vertical bars to horizontal bars (barh)
- **District names on y-axis**: Full names displayed (letter codes removed)
- **Improved readability**: Y-axis font increased from 10pt to 13pt
- **Better gridlines**: Increased alpha from 0.12 to 0.35, linewidth to 0.8
- **Dynamic height**: Chart height scales with number of districts (~40)
- **Fixed width**: 11 inches (fits portrait PDF perfectly)
- **Removed district code mapping table**: No longer needed, names on chart
- **Layout margins**: 28% left margin for district names
- **Sorting maintained**: Districts still sorted lowest to highest PPE (bottom to top)

**Issue 3: Redesigned Page 2 ALPS & Peers to horizontal bars**
- **90° rotation to match Page 1**: Changed from vertical to horizontal bars
- **Enrollment annotations preserved**: Now positioned to right of bars
- **Aggregate separation**: Western MA and PK-12 aggregates at bottom of chart
- **Color coding maintained**: Aggregates use gray palette, peers use blue
- **Font consistency**: Y-axis 13pt (district names), X-axis 16pt (PPE values)
- **Enrollment boxes**: Show FTE count and % change with color coding (blue/red)
- **Position adjustment**: Annotations at bar_end + 2% with left alignment
- **Legend repositioned**: At top with enrollment explainer text
- **Dynamic height**: Scales based on number of districts + aggregates
- **Layout margins**: 25% left for names, 28% right margin for annotations (72% right edge)

**Issue 4: PDF improvements**
- District Code Mapping table converted to 2-fold layout (was 3-fold)
- Added column headers: "Code", "District", "2024 PPE"
- Reduced horizontal spacing: 70% for district name, 25% for PPE
- Each fold uses 50% page width for better readability

**Code Comments Added (for future sessions)**
- Added NOTE comments explaining dynamic height calculations
- Documented bar stacking logic (base + delta segments)
- Explained aggregate vs peer district separation in horizontal layout
- Commented gridline improvements and font size choices
- Noted purpose of KeepInFrame wrapper for methodology content
- Documented removal of letter code mapping functionality

- Right-aligned enrollment boxes: Changed from left-aligned (at bar end) to right-aligned at fixed position
- Extended x-axis limit from 35000 to 38000 to create space for annotations
- Positioned enrollment boxes at x=37500 (well beyond longest bar) to prevent overlap
- Extended right margin from 72% to 78% to accommodate right-aligned annotations
- All enrollment boxes now form clean vertical column at right edge
- Fixed version stamp overlap with x-axis: Moved stamp from y=0.01 to y=0.03

**Issue 6: Page 1 Western overview - Highlight districts of interest**
- Highlighted 5 districts of interest in colorblind-friendly dark orange (#FF8C00)
- Districts: Amherst-Pelham, Amherst, Leverett, Pelham, Shutesbury
- Applied bold font weight in addition to color for extra emphasis
- Orange color chosen for strong contrast and visibility in both normal and colorblind vision

**Issue 7: Reordered all comparison tables to match chronological plot order**
- **Category table columns** (old→new):
  - OLD: Swatch, Category, 2024 $/pupil, CAGR 5y, 10y, 15y
  - NEW: Swatch (no header), Category, 2009 $/pupil, CAGR 15y, 10y, 5y, 2024 $/pupil
- **FTE table columns** (old→new):
  - OLD: Swatch, FTE Series, 2024 FTE, CAGR 5y, 10y, 15y
  - NEW: Swatch (no header), FTE Series, 2019 FTE, CAGR 15y, 10y, 5y, 2024 FTE
- **Rationale**: Left-to-right chronology matches plot timeline (oldest→newest)
- **Column width optimization**: Narrowed CAGR and $/pupil columns to prevent overflow
  - Category table: 0.85" for CAGR columns, 0.95" for $/pupil columns
  - FTE table: 0.85" for all numeric columns
- **Updated _build_category_data** to calculate and return start year values (15 years before latest)
  - Changed from t0_year (5 years back) to start_year (15 years back) to match CAGR 15y timeframe
  - Renamed return value from cat_t0_map to cat_start_map for clarity
  - Returns start year values for each spending category (2009 when latest is 2024)
- **Updated shading logic** to work with new column positions:
  - CAGR columns now 3-5 (15y, 10y, 5y) instead of 5-3
  - Latest $/pupil now column 6 instead of column 2
  - **NEW: Added shading for start year $/pupil (column 2, 2009)**
    - Uses same relative comparison as latest $/pupil: (District − Baseline) / Baseline
    - Compares 2009 district spending to 2009 Western baseline
    - Red if ≥2% higher, green if ≥2% lower
- **Added START_DOLLAR to all baseline_map constructions**
  - Baseline maps now include START_DOLLAR key with start year (15y back) value
  - Applied to all 4 baseline construction locations: ALPS vs Western, ALPS vs Peers, Districts vs Western, Districts vs Peers
  - Enables comparison shading for both 2009 and 2024 $/pupil columns
- **Removed swatch column header text** for cleaner appearance
- **Added start year total row values** for both category and FTE tables

**Issue 8: Added Table of Contents with clickable links**
- Created new `build_toc_page()` function to generate TOC page
- TOC includes 11 sections with internal PDF links:
  1. All Western MA Traditional Districts: PPE Overview 2019 -> 2024
  2. ALPS PK-12 & Peers: PPE and Enrollment 2019 -> 2024
  3. ALPS PK-12
  4. Amherst-Pelham Regional
  5. Amherst
  6. Leverett
  7. Pelham
  8. Shutesbury
  9. Appendix A. Aggregate Districts for Comparison
  10. Appendix B. Data Tables
  11. Appendix C. Calculation Methodology
- Added section_id field to relevant pages for anchor targets
- Modified build_pdf() to:
  - Handle TOC page type rendering
  - Add HTML anchors (`<a name="section_id"/>`) to section titles
  - Create clickable links (`<a href="#section_id">`) in TOC
- TOC inserted as first page of PDF

**Issue 9: Fixed duplicate data table pages in Appendix B**
- Problem: Districts with multiple comparison pages (vs Western and vs Peers) were creating duplicate data tables
- Solution: Added deduplication logic using `seen_districts` set
- Now each district appears exactly once in Appendix B data tables
- Reduced redundancy: ALPS PK-12 and each district (Amherst-Pelham, Amherst, Leverett, Pelham, Shutesbury) now have single data table page instead of duplicates

## 2025-10-02 - Session 7: Chapter 70 and Net School Spending (NSS) Analysis

### Objective
Integrate profile_DataC70 sheet data to analyze Chapter 70 state aid and Net School Spending on a per-pupil basis. Create stacked bar plots showing:
1. Chapter 70 Aid (bottom stack)
2. Required NSS minus Ch70 Aid (middle stack)
3. Actual NSS minus Required NSS (top stack)

### Implementation Details

**1. Data Integration and Normalization** (school_shared.py:169-197)
- Fixed district name mapping between sheets:
  - C70 data uses ALL CAPS with spaces (e.g., "AMHERST PELHAM")
  - Expenditure data uses Title Case with hyphens (e.g., "Amherst-Pelham")
  - Solution: Applied `.str.title()` and `.str.replace(" ", "-")` to normalize C70 district names
- Column mapping: C70 `fy` (fiscal year) → `YEAR` to match other sheets
- All districts of interest now match correctly (verified: Amherst-Pelham, Amherst, Leverett, Pelham, Shutesbury)

**2. Data Processing Functions** (school_shared.py:497-634)
- Created `prepare_district_nss_ch70()`: Single district NSS/Ch70 data on per-pupil basis
  - Joins C70 data with enrollment (In-District FTE) by year
  - Calculates three stacking components:
    - Ch70 Aid = c70aid / enrollment
    - Req NSS (adj) = max(0, rqdnss2 - c70aid) / enrollment
    - Actual NSS (adj) = (actualNSS - rqdnss2) / enrollment
  - Handles edge case: Ch70 > Required NSS (sets middle stack to 0)
- Created `prepare_aggregate_nss_ch70()`: Aggregate multiple districts
  - Sums dollar amounts across districts by year
  - Divides by total enrollment for per-pupil values
  - Used for ALPS PK-12 virtual district

**3. Plotting Functions** (nss_ch70_plots.py)
- Created `plot_nss_ch70()`: Stacked bar plot with enrollment line overlay
  - Twin axes: enrollment (left), $/pupil (right)
  - Color palette (colorblind-friendly):
    - Green (#4ade80): Chapter 70 Aid
    - Amber (#fbbf24): Required NSS (adj)
    - Purple (#a78bfa): Actual NSS (adj)
  - Legend shows both stacks and enrollment line
  - Figure size: 11.8 x 7.4 inches (matches expenditure plots)
- Created `compute_nss_ylim()`: Global y-axis limit computation
  - Computes max total (sum of all stacks) across all pivots
  - Adds 5% padding and rounds to nearest $500

**4. Table Generation Functions** (nss_ch70_plots.py:191-291)
- Created `build_nss_category_data()`: Table data with CAGR calculations
  - Returns category rows: (category, start_str, c15s, c10s, c5s, latest_str, color, latest_val)
  - Column order (chronological left-to-right): 2009, CAGR 15y, CAGR 10y, CAGR 5y, 2024
  - Computes total row: sum of all three stacks
  - Returns start_map for red/green shading comparisons (future integration)
- Helper functions:
  - `compute_cagr_last()`: CAGR calculation over N years
  - `fmt_pct()`: Percentage formatting with em-dash for NaN values

**5. Main Generation Script** (nss_ch70_main.py)
- Generates NSS/Ch70 plots for all districts of interest:
  - ALPS PK-12 (aggregate)
  - Amherst-Pelham
  - Amherst
  - Leverett
  - Pelham
  - Shutesbury
- Computes shared y-axis limits for consistent comparison
- Outputs PNG files to output/ directory

**7. Added NSS/Ch70 calculation methodology to Appendix C**
- Created methodology_page3 with comprehensive NSS/Ch70 explanation (compose_pdf.py:1384-1426)
  - Background: Chapter 70 and Net School Spending definitions
  - Data Sources: c70aid, rqdnss2, actualNSS, In-District FTE
  - Per-Pupil Calculation: Division by enrollment
  - Stacked Components with formulas:
    - Ch70 Aid ($/pupil) = c70aid / In-District FTE
    - Req NSS (adj) = max(0, rqdnss2 − c70aid) / In-District FTE
    - Actual NSS (adj) = (actualNSS − rqdnss2) / In-District FTE
  - Total NSS = Sum of all three components
  - Example Calculation using Amherst FY2024 data:
    - Enrollment: 1,083 students
    - Ch70 Aid: $6,791,000 / 1,083 = $6,271/pupil
    - Req NSS (adj): ($18,859,000 − $6,791,000) / 1,083 = $11,151/pupil
    - Actual NSS (adj): ($31,511,000 − $18,859,000) / 1,083 = $11,670/pupil
    - Total NSS: $6,271 + $11,151 + $11,670 = $29,093/pupil
  - Aggregate Calculation: Sum dollar amounts across districts, divide by total enrollment
  - Shading: Same 2% dollar / 2pp CAGR thresholds as PPE tables
- Added third methodology page to pages list (compose_pdf.py:1447-1454)
- Appendix C now has 3 pages:
  1. CAGR definition and aggregate calculations
  2. Red/green shading logic
  3. NSS/Ch70 calculations with example

**PDF Output:**
- Appendix B now includes NSS/Ch70 funding data tables for all districts
- Appendix C includes complete NSS/Ch70 methodology with worked example
- Each district's Appendix B page shows: PPE table, FTE table, NSS/Ch70 table

**8. Changed NSS/Ch70 to absolute dollars instead of per-pupil**
- Per user request based on DESE Researcher's Guide guidance about out-of-district costs
- Updated school_shared.py functions:
  - `prepare_district_nss_ch70()` (lines 498-564): Removed division by enrollment
    - Now returns absolute dollar values: c70aid, max(0, rqdnss2 - c70aid), actualNSS - rqdnss2
  - `prepare_aggregate_nss_ch70()` (lines 567-629): Removed per-pupil calculation
    - Now sums dollar amounts across districts without dividing by enrollment
- Updated nss_ch70_plots.py (line 105): Changed y-axis label from "$ per pupil" to "Dollars ($)"
- Updated compose_pdf.py throughout:
  - Narrowed Component column in NSS/Ch70 data table from 1.2" to 0.9" (line 828)
  - Removed "per-pupil" references from all NSS/Ch70 page subtitles
  - Updated Appendix B note to clarify "NSS/Ch70 funding components (in absolute dollars)"
  - Updated data table label: "NSS/Ch70 Funding Components ($)" (line 1620)
- Updated Appendix C methodology (lines 1396-1431):
  - Added important note explaining absolute dollars vs per-pupil
  - Updated all formulas to show absolute dollar calculations
  - Updated example calculation for Amherst FY2024:
    - Ch70 Aid: $6,791,000 (not per-pupil)
    - Req NSS (adj): $12,068,000 (not per-pupil)
    - Actual NSS (adj): $12,652,000 (not per-pupil)
    - Total NSS: $31,511,000 (not per-pupil)
  - Updated aggregate calculation: sum dollars across districts (no division)

**9. Added PPE definition to Appendix C**
- Added new section 1 to methodology_page1 (lines 1322-1327)
- Includes DESE Researcher's Guide quote about out-of-district expenditures:
  - "The out-of-district total cannot be properly reported as a per-pupil expenditure because the cost of tuitions varies greatly depending on the reason for going out of district."
- Explains PPE is calculated using in-district FTE only
- Renumbered subsequent sections (CAGR now #2, Aggregate Calculations now #3, etc.)

**PDF Output:**
- NSS/Ch70 plots now show absolute dollar amounts on y-axis
- NSS/Ch70 tables show dollar values without per-pupil division
- Plot scales are much larger (millions of dollars instead of thousands per pupil)
- CAGR calculations remain valid (percentage growth rates independent of per-pupil vs absolute)
- Red/green shading still works correctly for comparison to baselines

**10. Additional NSS/Ch70 refinements and ALPS relocation**
- Added ALPS PK-12 explanation to Appendix C (line 1342):
  - "This simulates the four towns of the Amherst-Pelham Regional District as a PK-12 unified district to support comparison with other PK-12 unified districts."
- Fixed NSS/Ch70 table headers (lines 438, 442):
  - Changed from "$/pupil" to just "$" for absolute dollar clarity
- Narrowed Component column in NSS/Ch70 summary tables (line 496):
  - Set Component column to fixed 1.4" width (was flexible)
  - Increased dollar columns to 1.0" for larger values (millions)
- Relocated ALPS PK-12 section after Shutesbury (lines 1041-1135):
  - Moved from page 2-3 position to after all individual districts
  - New page order: Amherst-Pelham, Amherst, Leverett, Pelham, Shutesbury, ALPS PK-12
  - Maintains all 3 pages per district structure (simple, vs Western, vs Peers, NSS/Ch70)
- Added number abbreviations to Appendix B NSS/Ch70 tables (lines 805-814):
  - Format function: ≥$1M shows as "$X.XM", ≥$1K shows as "$XK"
  - Examples: $6,791,000 → $6.8M, $12,068,000 → $12.1M
  - Prevents line wrapping for large aggregate values
- Limited Appendix B NSS/Ch70 tables to 2009-2024 (lines 797-800):
  - Filters years to 2009-2024 range only
  - Reduces column count from 16 to 16 years (matches data availability)
  - More horizontal space for each year column

**PDF Output:**
- NSS/Ch70 summary tables now accommodate $10M+ values without overflow
- Appendix B NSS/Ch70 tables show abbreviated values (6.8M, 12.1M)
- Table year range constrained to 2009-2024 for optimal layout
