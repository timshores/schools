# Work Log - School Data Analysis Project

## 2025-09-29 - Session Start

### Project Context
- Python scripts for analyzing MA school district expenditure data
- Migrated from ChatGPT web interface to Claude Code in VS Code
- Core files working together:
  - `school_shared.py` - Data loading and shared utilities
  - `district_expend_pp_stack.py` - Plot generation
  - `compose_pdf.py` - PDF report compilation

### Previous Work Completed
- âœ… Refactored and verified accuracy of three core files
- âœ… Created CALCULATION_REFERENCE.md for math verification

### Current Task
- ðŸ”„ Add appendix to PDF output showing all relevant data tables used in plots
- Goal: Enable readers to verify/understand plots by looking up values in tables
- Implementation needed in: `compose_pdf.py`

### Implementation Plan
1. âœ… Read compose_pdf.py and district_expend_pp_stack.py
2. âœ… Add data table formatting functions for:
   - Category expenditure per pupil data (epp_pivot DataFrames)
   - FTE enrollment data (lines dictionaries)
3. âœ… Create new appendix section ("Appendix B: Data Tables")
4. âœ… Format tables to show:
   - District/region name
   - All years of data (columns)
   - Categories/enrollment types (rows)
   - Values in readable format

### Changes Made (Session 2)
**Issue 1: Fixed table width overflow in Appendix B**
- Modified `_build_epp_data_table()` to accept doc_width parameter
- Modified `_build_fte_data_table()` to accept doc_width parameter
- Tables now dynamically calculate column widths to fit page width
- Changed table padding and font sizes to accommodate more columns

**Issue 2 & 3: Added calculation methodology and district membership lists**
- Added new "Calculation Methodology" page (Page 2) showing:
  - ALPS PK-12 aggregate calculation: weighted EPP formula with example
  - Member districts for ALPS PK-12: Amherst, Amherst-Pelham, Leverett, Pelham, Shutesbury
  - PK-12 District Aggregate calculation and 10 member districts
  - All Western MA Traditional Districts (â‰¤500) with full member list
  - All Western MA Traditional Districts (>500) with full member list
- Formula shown: Weighted_EPP = Î£(District_EPP Ã— District_In-District_FTE) / Î£(District_In-District_FTE)
- Enrollment calculation: Simple sum across all member districts

### Changes Made (Session 1)
- Added two new functions to compose_pdf.py:
  - `_build_epp_data_table()`: Creates tables showing expenditure per pupil by category across all years
  - `_build_fte_data_table()`: Creates tables showing FTE enrollment data across all years
- Modified `build_page_dicts()` to:
  - Store raw data (raw_epp, raw_lines) in page dictionaries
  - Add "Appendix B: Data Tables" section after Appendix A
  - Create data table pages for each district/region
- Modified `build_pdf()` to handle "data_table" page type
- Result: PDF now includes complete data tables for all districts and regions at the end

### Changes Made (Session 3)
**Issue 1: Move methodology to Appendix C and add CAGR**
- Moved "Calculation Methodology" from Page 2 to Appendix C (after data tables)
- Added detailed CAGR explanation with formula: CAGR = (End/Start)^(1/Years) âˆ’ 1
- Added example: $10,000 â†’ $12,000 over 5 years = 3.71% CAGR

**Issue 2: Fix data table font wrapping**
- Created new style `style_data_cell` with fontSize=7, leading=9
- Applied to all data cells in EPP and FTE tables in Appendix B
- Maintains readability while preventing line wrapping

**Issue 3-5: Improve first page comparative plot**
- Removed enrollment subplot (microplots) entirely
- Increased BAR_WIDTH from 0.58 to 0.75 (30% wider)
- Reduced SPACING_FACTOR from 1.35 to 0.95 (tighter spacing)
- Added enrollment change annotations directly on bars:
  - Shows absolute change (e.g., "+150" or "-50")
  - Shows percentage change (e.g., "+5.2%" or "-3.1%")
  - Color coded: blue for increases, red for decreases
  - Displayed in bordered boxes above each bar
- Reduced figure height from 14.0 to 10.0 (removed subplot space)
- Updated legend to remove enrollment microplot reference
- Added subtitle text explaining enrollment annotations

### Changes Made (Session 4 - Major Restructuring)
**Issue 1: Fixed data table word-wrapping**
- Reduced data cell font to fontSize=6, leading=8
- Reduced header font to fontSize=7, leading=9
- All values now fit on single lines without wrapping

**Issue 2-3: Consolidated appendix intro pages**
- Appendix A intro now on same page as first Western MA chart
- Appendix B intro now on same page as first data table
- Removed standalone intro pages, saving 2 pages

**Issue 4-7: Improved first page comparative plot**
- Moved legend from bottom to top (loc="upper center")
- Increased enrollment annotation font from 10 to 12
- Increased note font from 13 to 14
- Changed crimson color from #DC2626 to #B91C1C (deeper crimson)
- Note text now matches crimson color
- Adjusted layout: top=0.92, bottom=0.08

**Issue 8-9: BIG CHANGE - Two pages per district**
- Created new `plot_one_simple()` function for solid-color PPE plots
- Each district now has TWO pages:
  1. **Simple version**: Solid indigo color (#4F46E5), no category breakdown, no tables
  2. **Detailed version**: Category stacks with tables (original format)
- Title distinguishes them: "...(Detailed)" added to second page
- Applies to: ALPS PK-12, Amherst-Pelham, Amherst, Leverett, Pelham, Shutesbury
- Doubled plot generation: 6 districts Ã— 2 versions = 12 plots
- Gives readers quick overview first, then detailed breakdown

### Test Results
âœ… PDF generates successfully (4.7MB - larger due to double pages)
âœ… Tables fit within page width without wrapping
âœ… Methodology page shows all formulas and district lists
âœ… Appendix A consolidated with first chart
âœ… Appendix B consolidated with first data table
âœ… Appendix C shows CAGR calculation with examples
âœ… First page plot: legend above, larger fonts, crimson color
âœ… All districts have both simple and detailed pages
âœ… Simple plots use solid indigo color
âœ… 27 PNG files generated (15 district plots, 2 Western plots, 1 comparative)

### Data Structures Identified
- **epp_pivot**: pd.DataFrame with years as index, spending categories as columns, $/pupil as values
- **lines**: Dict[str, pd.Series] with enrollment series (In-District FTE, Out-of-District FTE)
- Each page dict already contains cat_rows, cat_total, fte_rows with aggregated data

### Changes Made (Session 5 - Layout and Spacing Improvements)
**Issue 1: Fixed Appendix C pagination**
- Split methodology content into two separate pages to avoid footer overlap
- Page 1: CAGR definition and Aggregate District Calculations (37 lines)
- Page 2: Red/Green Shading Logic (23 lines)
- Each page stays well above the 5-line buffer before footer boundary

**Issue 2: Improved Page 1 (Western overview) layout**
- Increased figure height from 10.0 to 13.0 inches for more breathing room
- Increased x-axis tick label font from 18 to 22
- Increased y-axis label font from 24 to 26
- Increased legend font from 20 to 22
- Set legend ncol=3 explicitly for single-row layout
- Adjusted subplot margins: top from 0.94 to 0.90, giving plot more vertical space
- Legend repositioned from bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 1.00) to (0.5, 0.97)
- Plot is now much taller and less cramped

**Issue 3: Fixed Page 2 (ALPS & Peers) legend/annotation overlap**
- Increased annotation spacing from 2% to 3% of y-axis max (PPE_PEERS_YMAX = 35000)
- Moved enrollment explainer text from y=0.995 to y=0.985
- Moved legend from bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 0.98) to (0.5, 0.96)
- Adjusted subplot top margin from 0.92 to 0.88
- Creates more vertical space between bars/annotations and legend/text
- Prevents overlap of enrollment rectangles with legend
