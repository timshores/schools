--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 COHORT BOUNDARY DETERMINATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cohort boundaries are determined by reference to Interquartile Range (IQR) analysis on Fiscal Year 2024 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) in-district enrollment for all traditional public school districts in Western Massachusetts. Cohort boundaries are rounded for easier readability.

Step 1: Extract FY24 In-district FTE enrollment data
From Sheet "District Expend by Category", filter rows where:
• IND_CAT = "Student Enrollment"
• IND_SUBCAT = "In-District FTE Pupils" (Full-Time Equivalent students enrolled in district-operated schools)
• YEAR = 2024

Step 2: Calculate quartile statistics
Using the 60 traditional districts in Western MA with valid data (including Springfield), calculate:
• First quartile (Q1) = 25th percentile = 154.7 In-district FTE
• Second quartile/Median (Q2) = 50th percentile = 792.0 In-district FTE
• Third quartile (Q3) = 75th percentile = 1,597.6 In-district FTE
• 90th percentile (P90) = 3,571.1 In-district FTE

Step 3: Define cohort boundaries
• TINY: 0 to 200 In-district FTE (from zero to Q1 rounded to nearest 100)
• SMALL: 201 to 800 In-district FTE (from max TINY +1 to Median rounded to nearest 100)
• MEDIUM: 801 to 1,600 In-district FTE (from max SMALL +1 to Q3 rounded to nearest 100)
• LARGE: 1,601 to 4,000 In-district FTE (from max MEDIUM +1 to P90 rounded to nearest 1,000)
• X-LARGE: 4,001 to 10K In-district FTE (from max LARGE +1 to fixed threshold of 10,000)
• OUTLIERS (Springfield): Greater than fixed threshold of 10,000 In-district FTE

Step 4: Assign each district to its cohort
For each district, compare its FY24 In-district FTE enrollment to the boundaries above.

Example: Amherst-Pelham Regional has 1,209.3 In-district FTE in FY24
Since 801 ≤ 1,209.3 ≤ 1,600, Amherst-Pelham is assigned to the MEDIUM cohort.

Example: Gill-Montague Regional has 899.8 In-district FTE in FY24
Since 801 ≤ 899.8 ≤ 1,600, Gill-Montague is assigned to the MEDIUM cohort.

Example: Belchertown has 2,067.8 In-district FTE in FY24
Since 1,601 ≤ 2,067.8 ≤ 4,000, Belchertown is assigned to the LARGE cohort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2 EXPENDITURE CATEGORIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All Per-Pupil Expenditure (PPE) calculations use eight categories:

1. Teachers
2. Insurance, Retirement and Other
3. Pupil Services
4. Other Teaching Services
5. Operations and Maintenance
6. Instructional Leadership
7. Administration
8. Other

These categories are derived from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) function code groupings in end-of-year reporting, and provide a standardized breakdown of all district expenditures. Note: District budgeting practices typically use categories that do not match the DESE end-of-year reporting standard.

================================================================================
PART 2: WESTERN MA MEDIUM COHORT CALCULATIONS
================================================================================

The Medium cohort contains 15 districts with in-district enrollment between 801 and 1,600 FTE in FY24. This section demonstrates how weighted average Per-Pupil Expenditure (PPE) is calculated for the cohort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 MEMBER DISTRICTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Districts in the Medium cohort (sorted by FY24 In-district FTE enrollment):
1. Mohawk Trail: 804.8 In-district FTE
2. Monson: 807.8 In-district FTE
3. Gill-Montague: 899.8 In-district FTE
4. Amherst: 1,001.5 In-district FTE
5. Hoosac Valley Regional: 1,002.7 In-district FTE
6. Palmer: 1,061.5 In-district FTE
7. Ware: 1,095.8 In-district FTE
8. Berkshire Hills: 1,174.4 In-district FTE
9. North Adams: 1,196.0 In-district FTE
10. Mount Greylock: 1,206.9 In-district FTE
11. Amherst-Pelham: 1,209.3 In-district FTE
12. Southwick-Tolland-Granville Regional School District: 1,312.8 In-district FTE
13. Greenfield: 1,394.0 In-district FTE
14. Easthampton: 1,403.7 In-district FTE
15. Central Berkshire: 1,585.9 In-district FTE

Total In-district FTE for Medium cohort = Sum of all member In-district FTE = 17,156.9 FTE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 WEIGHTED AVERAGE PPE CALCULATION (EXAMPLE: FY2024 TEACHERS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each expenditure category, we calculate an enrollment-weighted average across all districts in the cohort.

Step 1: Extract per-pupil expenditure data for Teachers category
From Sheet "District Expend by Category", filter rows where:
• IND_CAT = "Expenditures per Pupil"
• IND_SUBCAT = "Teachers"
• YEAR = 2024

Step 2: For each district, multiply PPE by enrollment weight
Example calculations for first three districts:

Mohawk Trail:
• FY24 Teachers PPE = [actual value from data] per pupil
• FY24 In-district FTE Enrollment = 804.8 FTE
• Weight = 804.8 / 17,156.9 = 0.0469 (4.69% of cohort enrollment)
• Weighted contribution = [Teachers PPE] × 0.0469

Monson:
• FY24 Teachers PPE = [actual value from data] per pupil
• FY24 In-district FTE Enrollment = 807.8 FTE
• Weight = 807.8 / 17,156.9 = 0.0471 (4.71% of cohort enrollment)
• Weighted contribution = [Teachers PPE] × 0.0471

Gill-Montague:
• FY24 Teachers PPE = [actual value from data] per pupil
• FY24 In-district FTE Enrollment = 899.8 FTE
• Weight = 899.8 / 17,156.9 = 0.0524 (5.24% of cohort enrollment)
• Weighted contribution = [Teachers PPE] × 0.0524

[Continue for all 15 districts...]

Step 3: Sum all weighted contributions
Weighted Average Teachers PPE = Sum of all weighted contributions = [calculated value] per pupil

This weighted average calculation is repeated for all eight categories:
1. Teachers
2. Insurance, Retirement and Other
3. Pupil Services
4. Other Teaching Services
5. Operations and Maintenance
6. Instructional Leadership
7. Administration
8. Other

Step 4: Calculate total weighted average PPE
Total Weighted Average PPE (FY24) = Sum of all eight category weighted averages
= Teachers + Insurance + Pupil Services + Other Teaching + Operations + Instructional Leadership + Administration + Other
= [sum of actual calculated values] per pupil

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 TIME SERIES CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The same weighted average calculation is performed for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2024, producing a time series of cohort-level PPE values.

For each year Y from 2009 to 2024:
1. Extract FY Y enrollment for all 13 Medium cohort districts
2. Calculate cohort total enrollment for year Y
3. For each of the 8 expenditure categories:
   a. Extract PPE values for year Y
   b. Calculate enrollment weight for each district in year Y
   c. Calculate weighted average PPE for that category in year Y
4. Sum the 8 category weighted averages to get total PPE for year Y

This produces arrays:
• Years: [2009, 2010, 2011, ..., 2024]
• Total PPE: [PPE_2009, PPE_2010, PPE_2011, ..., PPE_2024]
• Teachers PPE: [Teachers_2009, Teachers_2010, ..., Teachers_2024]
• [Similar arrays for other 7 categories]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4 COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE (CAGR)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAGR measures the annualized growth rate over multiple years.

Formula:
CAGR = ((Value_end / Value_start)^(1/number_of_years) - 1) × 100%

Where:
• Value_end = PPE in final year (2024)
• Value_start = PPE in initial year (2009)
• number_of_years = 2024 - 2009 = 15 years

Example for Medium cohort Total PPE:
• PPE_2009 = [calculated weighted average for 2009] per pupil
• PPE_2024 = [calculated weighted average for 2024] per pupil
• Number of years = 15

CAGR = ((PPE_2024 / PPE_2009)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
     = [calculated value] % per year

This calculation is performed for:
• Total PPE CAGR
• Each of the 8 category-specific PPE CAGRs
• Chapter 70 state aid CAGR
• Net School Spending (NSS) CAGR
• Enrollment CAGR

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.5 YEAR-OVER-YEAR (YOY) GROWTH RATE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Year-over-Year (YoY) growth rate measures the percentage change from one year to the next, providing insight into annual fluctuations in expenditures.

Formula:
YoY Growth Rate = ((Value_year / Value_previous_year) - 1) × 100%

Where:
• Value_year = PPE in current year
• Value_previous_year = PPE in previous year

Example for Medium cohort Total PPE:
Assume the time series shows:
• PPE_2009 = $12,000 per pupil
• PPE_2010 = $12,500 per pupil
• PPE_2011 = $13,000 per pupil
• PPE_2012 = $13,100 per pupil
• ...

YoY calculations:
• YoY_2010 = (($12,500 / $12,000) - 1) × 100% = 4.17%
• YoY_2011 = (($13,000 / $12,500) - 1) × 100% = 4.00%
• YoY_2012 = (($13,100 / $13,000) - 1) × 100% = 0.77%
• ...

Key differences from CAGR:
• YoY shows year-to-year changes; CAGR smooths growth over multiple years
• YoY captures annual volatility; CAGR assumes constant growth
• YoY is useful for identifying specific years with unusual growth patterns

Example comparison:
If CAGR from 2009 to 2024 is 3.71% per year, but YoY rates vary from 0.5% to 8.0% across individual years, this reveals that growth was not constant—some years had much higher or lower increases than the average.

Use cases:
• Identifying years with budget constraints (low YoY)
• Identifying years with significant increases (high YoY)
• Understanding the impact of specific events (e.g., pandemic, policy changes) on year-to-year spending

This YoY calculation is performed for:
• Total PPE YoY for each year from 2010 to 2024 (15 values)
• Each of the 8 category-specific PPE YoY rates
• Chapter 70 state aid YoY
• Net School Spending (NSS) YoY
• Enrollment YoY

Note: YoY for year N requires data from year N-1, so the first YoY value is for 2010 (comparing 2010 to 2009).

================================================================================
PART 3: AMHERST-PELHAM REGIONAL DISTRICT CALCULATIONS
================================================================================

This section demonstrates all calculations for a single district: Amherst-Pelham Regional.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 DISTRICT PROFILE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

District: Amherst-Pelham Regional
Cohort Assignment: MEDIUM (801-1,600 In-district FTE)
FY24 In-district FTE Enrollment: 1,209.3 FTE

Data Source: Appendix A Data Tables
• Enrollment data: See "In-District FTE" column in Appendix A
• PPE data: See expenditure category columns in Appendix A
• Chapter 70 data: See "Chapter 70 Aid" column in Appendix A
• NSS data: See "Required NSS" and "Actual NSS" columns in Appendix A

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 ENROLLMENT TIME SERIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Extract in-district enrollment data
From Appendix A Data Tables, locate:
• District: "Amherst-Pelham Regional"
• Find the "In-District FTE" column
• Read values for all years from 2009 to 2024

Step 2: Create time series array
Years: [2009, 2010, 2011, ..., 2023, 2024]
In-district FTE: [FTE_2009, FTE_2010, FTE_2011, ..., FTE_2023, 1,209.3]

(Extract actual values for each year from Appendix A)

Step 3: Calculate enrollment CAGR
CAGR = ((FTE_2024 / FTE_2009)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
     = ((1,209.3 / FTE_2009)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
     = [calculated value] % per year

Where:
• FTE_2024 = 1,209.3 In-district FTE (from data)
• FTE_2009 = [actual value from data] In-district FTE
• Number of years = 15 (2024 - 2009)

A negative CAGR indicates declining enrollment, positive indicates growth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 PER-PUPIL EXPENDITURE CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Amherst-Pelham Regional, PPE is calculated for each of the eight categories:

1. Teachers
2. Insurance, Retirement and Other
3. Pupil Services
4. Other Teaching Services
5. Operations and Maintenance
6. Instructional Leadership
7. Administration
8. Other

Step 1: Extract PPE data for each category
From Appendix A Data Tables, locate:
• District: "Amherst-Pelham Regional"
• Find the columns for each of the 8 expenditure categories
• Read values for all years from 2009 to 2024

Step 2: Example calculation for Teachers category (FY2024)
From Appendix A Data Tables:
• District: "Amherst-Pelham Regional"
• Year: 2024
• Column: "Teachers"
• Value: [actual value from Appendix A] per pupil

This value represents the amount Amherst-Pelham Regional spent per Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) student on Teachers in FY2024.

Step 3: Calculate total PPE for FY2024
Total PPE (FY2024) = Teachers + Insurance, Retirement and Other + Pupil Services + Other Teaching Services + Operations and Maintenance + Instructional Leadership + Administration + Other

Using column IND_VALUE for YEAR = 2024 and each category:
• Teachers: [actual value]
• Insurance, Retirement and Other: [actual value]
• Pupil Services: [actual value]
• Other Teaching Services: [actual value]
• Operations and Maintenance: [actual value]
• Instructional Leadership: [actual value]
• Administration: [actual value]
• Other: [actual value]

Total PPE (FY2024) = [sum of actual values] per pupil

Step 4: Repeat for all years 2009-2024
For each year from 2009 to 2024, extract IND_VALUE for each of the 8 categories and sum them to get total PPE for that year.

This produces time series arrays:
• Years: [2009, 2010, ..., 2024]
• Total PPE: [PPE_2009, PPE_2010, ..., PPE_2024]
• Teachers: [Teachers_2009, Teachers_2010, ..., Teachers_2024]
• Insurance, Retirement and Other: [Insurance_2009, Insurance_2010, ..., Insurance_2024]
• Pupil Services: [Pupil_Services_2009, Pupil_Services_2010, ..., Pupil_Services_2024]
• Other Teaching Services: [Other_Teaching_2009, Other_Teaching_2010, ..., Other_Teaching_2024]
• Operations and Maintenance: [Operations_2009, Operations_2010, ..., Operations_2024]
• Instructional Leadership: [Instructional_Leadership_2009, Instructional_Leadership_2010, ..., Instructional_Leadership_2024]
• Administration: [Administration_2009, Administration_2010, ..., Administration_2024]
• Other: [Other_2009, Other_2010, ..., Other_2024]

Step 5: Calculate CAGR for each category

Formula: CAGR = ((Value_2024 / Value_2009)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%

Example for Teachers:
• Teachers_2009 = [actual value from data] per pupil
• Teachers_2024 = [actual value from data] per pupil
• CAGR_Teachers = ((Teachers_2024 / Teachers_2009)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
                = [calculated value] % per year

Repeat this calculation for all 8 categories plus total PPE to get 9 CAGR values.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 CHAPTER 70 STATE AID CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 70 is the major state aid program for Massachusetts K-12 public schools.

Step 1: Extract Chapter 70 data
From Appendix A Data Tables, locate:
• District: "Amherst-Pelham Regional"
• Column: "Chapter 70 Aid"
• Read values for all years from 2009 to 2024

Step 2: Extract total district expenditures
From Appendix A Data Tables, calculate total expenditure as:
• District: "Amherst-Pelham Regional"
• Sum of all expenditure categories for each year
• Alternatively, use "Actual NSS" column if available

Step 3: Calculate Chapter 70 as percentage of total expenditure (FY2024 example)
• Chapter 70 Aid (FY2024) = [value from "Chapter 70 Aid" column in Appendix A for 2024]
• Total Expenditure (FY2024) = [sum of expenditure categories from Appendix A for 2024]
• Percentage = (Chapter 70 Aid / Total Expenditure) × 100%

This percentage shows what portion of the district's total expenditure came from Chapter 70 state aid in FY2024.

Step 4: Calculate Chapter 70 per-pupil (FY2024 example)
• Chapter 70 Aid (FY2024) = [value from "Chapter 70 Aid" column in Appendix A]
• Enrollment (FY2024) = 1,209.3 In-district FTE
• Chapter 70 Per-Pupil = Chapter 70 Aid / 1,209.3 FTE = [calculated value] per FTE

Step 5: Calculate Chapter 70 CAGR
• Chapter 70 Aid (2009) = [value from "Chapter 70 Aid" column in Appendix A for 2009]
• Chapter 70 Aid (2024) = [value from "Chapter 70 Aid" column in Appendix A for 2024]
• CAGR = ((Ch70Aid_2024 / Ch70Aid_2009)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
       = [calculated value] % per year

A negative CAGR indicates that Chapter 70 aid decreased, positive indicates growth.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5 NET SCHOOL SPENDING (NSS) CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net School Spending (NSS) is the total amount a school district spends on education from all sources, excluding certain items like transportation, debt service, and capital expenditures.

Step 1: Extract NSS data
From Appendix A Data Tables, locate:
• District: "Amherst-Pelham Regional"
• Columns: "Required NSS" and "Actual NSS"
• Read values for all years from 2009 to 2024

Step 2: Calculate NSS per-pupil (FY2024 example)
• Total NSS (FY2024) = [value from "Actual NSS" column in Appendix A for 2024]
• Enrollment (FY2024) = 1,209.3 In-district FTE
• NSS Per-Pupil = Total NSS / 1,209.3 FTE = [calculated value] per FTE

Step 3: Calculate NSS CAGR
• NSS (2009) = [value from "Actual NSS" column in Appendix A for 2009]
• NSS (2024) = [value from "Actual NSS" column in Appendix A for 2024]
• CAGR = ((NSS_2024 / NSS_2009)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
       = [calculated value] % per year

This indicates the average annual growth rate of NSS from 2009 to 2024.

Step 4: Compare NSS per-pupil to cohort average
Using the weighted average calculation method described in Part 2, the MEDIUM cohort average NSS per-pupil (FY2024) = [calculated weighted average] per FTE.

Amherst-Pelham's NSS per-pupil ([actual value from calculation]) is [percentage difference]% [above/below] the MEDIUM cohort average.

Calculation: ((Amherst-Pelham NSS per-pupil - MEDIUM cohort average) / MEDIUM cohort average) × 100%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All district-specific calculations can be compared to:

1. Cohort averages (in this case, MEDIUM cohort weighted averages for Amherst-Pelham Regional)
2. Regional averages (all Western MA traditional districts)
3. Statewide averages (if available)

For each metric (Total PPE, each of 8 category PPEs, Chapter 70 per-pupil, NSS per-pupil, enrollment growth), calculate:
• District value
• Cohort average
• Difference = District value - Cohort average
• Percentage difference = (Difference / Cohort average) × 100%

These comparisons reveal whether a district is spending more or less than similar-sized districts, and where specific spending differences occur across the eight categories:
1. Teachers
2. Insurance, Retirement and Other
3. Pupil Services
4. Other Teaching Services
5. Operations and Maintenance
6. Instructional Leadership
7. Administration
8. Other
