--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 COHORT BOUNDARY DETERMINATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cohort boundaries are determined by reference to Interquartile Range (IQR) analysis on Fiscal Year 2024 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) in-district enrollment for all traditional public school districts in Western Massachusetts. Cohort boundaries are rounded for easier readability.

Step 1: Extract FY24 In-district FTE enrollment data
From Sheet "District Expend by Category", filter rows where:
• IND_CAT = "Student Enrollment"
• IND_SUBCAT = "In-District FTE Pupils" (Full-Time Equivalent students enrolled in district-operated schools)
• YEAR = 2024

Step 2: Calculate quartile statistics
Using the 54 traditional districts in Western MA, calculate:
• First quartile (Q1) = 25th percentile = 200 FTE (rounded to nearest 100)
• Second quartile/Median (Q2) = 50th percentile = 800 FTE (rounded to nearest 100)
• Third quartile (Q3) = 75th percentile = 1,800 FTE (rounded to nearest 100)
• 90th percentile (P90) = 3,000 FTE (rounded to nearest 1,000)

Step 3: Define cohort boundaries
• TINY: 0 to 200 In-district FTE (from zero to Q1)
• SMALL: 201 to 800 In-district FTE (from Q1+1 to Median)
• MEDIUM: 801 to 1,800 In-district FTE (from Median+1 to Q3)
• LARGE: 1,801 to 3,000 In-district FTE (from Q3+1 to P90)
• X-LARGE: 3,001 to 10K In-district FTE (from P90+1 to fixed threshold)
• OUTLIERS (Springfield): Greater than 10,000 In-district FTE

Step 4: Assign each district to its cohort
For each district, compare its FY24 In-district FTE enrollment to the boundaries above.

Example: Amherst-Pelham Regional has 1,808 In-district FTE in FY24
Since 1,801 ≤ 1,808 ≤ 3,000, Amherst-Pelham is assigned to the LARGE cohort.

Example: Gill-Montague Regional has 876 In-district FTE in FY24
Since 801 ≤ 876 ≤ 1,800, Gill-Montague is assigned to the MEDIUM cohort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2 EXPENDITURE CATEGORIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All Per-Pupil Expenditure (PPE) calculations use eight categories:

1. Teachers
2. Insurance, Retirement and Other
3. Pupil Services
4. Other Teaching Services
5. Operations and Maintenance
6. Instructional Leadership
7. Administration
8. Other

These categories are derived from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) function code groupings in end-of-year reporting, and provide a standardized breakdown of all district expenditures. Note: District budgeting practices typically use categories that do not match the DESE end-of-year reporting standard.

================================================================================
PART 2: WESTERN MA MEDIUM COHORT CALCULATIONS
================================================================================

The Medium cohort contains 13 districts with in-district enrollment between 801 and 1,800 FTE in FY24. This section demonstrates how weighted average Per-Pupil Expenditure (PPE) is calculated for the cohort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 MEMBER DISTRICTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Districts in the Medium cohort (sorted by FY24 In-district FTE enrollment):
1. Gill-Montague Regional: 876 In-district FTE
2. Athol-Royalston Regional: 1,009 In-district FTE
3. Ware: 1,067 In-district FTE
4. Lee: 1,128 In-district FTE
5. Lenox: 1,181 In-district FTE
6. Greenfield: 1,282 In-district FTE
7. Adams-Cheshire Regional: 1,300 In-district FTE
8. Mohawk Trail Regional: 1,314 In-district FTE
9. Easthampton: 1,415 In-district FTE
10. Palmer: 1,471 In-district FTE
11. Frontier Regional: 1,503 In-district FTE
12. Southwick-Tolland-Granville Regional: 1,577 In-district FTE
13. Belchertown: 1,796 In-district FTE

Total In-district FTE for Medium cohort = Sum of all member In-district FTE = 16,919 FTE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 WEIGHTED AVERAGE PPE CALCULATION (EXAMPLE: FY2024 TEACHERS)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each expenditure category, we calculate an enrollment-weighted average across all districts in the cohort.

Step 1: Extract per-pupil expenditure data for Teachers category
From Sheet "District Expend by Category", filter rows where:
• IND_CAT = "Expenditures per Pupil"
• IND_SUBCAT = "Teachers"
• YEAR = 2024

Step 2: For each district, multiply PPE by enrollment weight
Example calculations for first three districts:

Gill-Montague Regional:
• FY24 Teachers PPE = $5,234 per pupil
• FY24 In-district FTE Enrollment = 876 FTE
• Weight = 876 / 16,919 = 0.0518 (5.18% of cohort enrollment)
• Weighted contribution = $5,234 × 0.0518 = $271

Athol-Royalston Regional:
• FY24 Teachers PPE = $4,892 per pupil
• FY24 In-district FTE Enrollment = 1,009 FTE
• Weight = 1,009 / 16,919 = 0.0596 (5.96% of cohort enrollment)
• Weighted contribution = $4,892 × 0.0596 = $292

Ware:
• FY24 Teachers PPE = $5,011 per pupil
• FY24 In-district FTE Enrollment = 1,067 FTE
• Weight = 1,067 / 16,919 = 0.0631 (6.31% of cohort enrollment)
• Weighted contribution = $5,011 × 0.0631 = $316

[Continue for all 13 districts...]

Step 3: Sum all weighted contributions
Weighted Average Teachers PPE = Sum of all weighted contributions = $5,087 per pupil

This weighted average calculation is repeated for all eight categories:
1. Teachers
2. Insurance, Retirement and Other
3. Pupil Services
4. Other Teaching Services
5. Operations and Maintenance
6. Instructional Leadership
7. Administration
8. Other

Step 4: Calculate total weighted average PPE
Total Weighted Average PPE (FY24) = Sum of all eight category weighted averages
= Teachers + Insurance + Pupil Services + Other Teaching + Operations + Instructional Leadership + Administration + Other
= $5,087 + $3,421 + $1,876 + $1,234 + $1,987 + $654 + $1,123 + $892
= $16,274 per pupil (example values)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3 TIME SERIES CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The same weighted average calculation is performed for each fiscal year from 2009 to 2024, producing a time series of cohort-level PPE values.

For each year Y from 2009 to 2024:
1. Extract FY Y enrollment for all 13 Medium cohort districts
2. Calculate cohort total enrollment for year Y
3. For each of the 8 expenditure categories:
   a. Extract PPE values for year Y
   b. Calculate enrollment weight for each district in year Y
   c. Calculate weighted average PPE for that category in year Y
4. Sum the 8 category weighted averages to get total PPE for year Y

This produces arrays:
• Years: [2009, 2010, 2011, ..., 2024]
• Total PPE: [PPE_2009, PPE_2010, PPE_2011, ..., PPE_2024]
• Teachers PPE: [Teachers_2009, Teachers_2010, ..., Teachers_2024]
• [Similar arrays for other 7 categories]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.4 COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE (CAGR)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CAGR measures the annualized growth rate over multiple years.

Formula:
CAGR = ((Value_end / Value_start)^(1/number_of_years) - 1) × 100%

Where:
• Value_end = PPE in final year (2024)
• Value_start = PPE in initial year (2009)
• number_of_years = 2024 - 2009 = 15 years

Example for Medium cohort Total PPE (using example values):
• PPE_2009 = $12,456 per pupil
• PPE_2024 = $16,274 per pupil
• Number of years = 15

CAGR = (($16,274 / $12,456)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
     = ((1.3065)^(0.0667) - 1) × 100%
     = (1.0181 - 1) × 100%
     = 0.0181 × 100%
     = 1.81% per year

This calculation is performed for:
• Total PPE CAGR
• Each of the 8 category-specific PPE CAGRs
• Chapter 70 state aid CAGR
• Net School Spending (NSS) CAGR
• Enrollment CAGR

================================================================================
PART 3: AMHERST-PELHAM REGIONAL DISTRICT CALCULATIONS
================================================================================

This section demonstrates all calculations for a single district: Amherst-Pelham Regional.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 DISTRICT PROFILE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

District: Amherst-Pelham Regional
Cohort Assignment: LARGE (1,801-3,000 In-district FTE)
FY24 In-district FTE Enrollment: 1,808 FTE

Data Source: File "E2C_Hub_MA_DESE_Data.xlsx"
• Enrollment data from Sheet "District Expend by Category"
• PPE data from Sheet "District Expend by Category"
• Chapter 70 data from Sheet "profile_DataC70"
• NSS data from Sheet "profile_DataC70"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 ENROLLMENT TIME SERIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Extract in-district enrollment data
From Sheet "District Expend by Category", filter rows where:
• DIST_NAME = "Amherst-Pelham Regional"
• IND_CAT = "Student Enrollment"
• IND_SUBCAT = "In-District FTE Pupils"
• YEAR ranges from 2009 to 2024

Step 2: Create time series array
Years: [2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024]
In-district FTE: [2,145, 2,134, 2,098, 2,067, 2,034, 2,001, 1,978, 1,956, 1,923, 1,897, 1,876, 1,853, 1,842, 1,829, 1,817, 1,808]

Step 3: Calculate enrollment CAGR
CAGR = ((FTE_2024 / FTE_2009)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
     = ((1,808 / 2,145)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
     = ((0.8429)^(0.0667) - 1) × 100%
     = (0.9887 - 1) × 100%
     = -0.0113 × 100%
     = -1.13% per year

The negative CAGR indicates declining enrollment at an average rate of 1.13% per year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 PER-PUPIL EXPENDITURE CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For Amherst-Pelham Regional, PPE is calculated for each of the eight categories:

1. Teachers
2. Insurance, Retirement and Other
3. Pupil Services
4. Other Teaching Services
5. Operations and Maintenance
6. Instructional Leadership
7. Administration
8. Other

Step 1: Extract PPE data for each category
From Sheet "District Expend by Category", filter rows where:
• DIST_NAME = "Amherst-Pelham Regional"
• IND_CAT = "Expenditures per Pupil"
• IND_SUBCAT = [one of the 8 categories listed above]
• YEAR ranges from 2009 to 2024

Step 2: Example calculation for Teachers category (FY2024)
From filtered data:
• IND_SUBCAT = "Teachers"
• YEAR = 2024
• IND_VALUE = $5,876 per pupil

This means Amherst-Pelham Regional spent $5,876 per Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) student on Teachers in FY2024.

Step 3: Calculate total PPE for FY2024
Total PPE (FY2024) = Teachers + Insurance, Retirement and Other + Pupil Services + Other Teaching Services + Operations and Maintenance + Instructional Leadership + Administration + Other

Using column IND_VALUE for YEAR = 2024 and each category:
• Teachers: $5,876
• Insurance, Retirement and Other: $3,654
• Pupil Services: $2,012
• Other Teaching Services: $1,456
• Operations and Maintenance: $2,234
• Instructional Leadership: $789
• Administration: $1,345
• Other: $1,123

Total PPE (FY2024) = $5,876 + $3,654 + $2,012 + $1,456 + $2,234 + $789 + $1,345 + $1,123
                   = $18,489 per pupil

Step 4: Repeat for all years 2009-2024
For each year from 2009 to 2024, extract IND_VALUE for each of the 8 categories and sum them to get total PPE for that year.

This produces time series arrays:
• Years: [2009, 2010, ..., 2024]
• Total PPE: [PPE_2009, PPE_2010, ..., PPE_2024]
• Teachers: [Teachers_2009, Teachers_2010, ..., Teachers_2024]
• Insurance, Retirement and Other: [Insurance_2009, Insurance_2010, ..., Insurance_2024]
• Pupil Services: [Pupil_Services_2009, Pupil_Services_2010, ..., Pupil_Services_2024]
• Other Teaching Services: [Other_Teaching_2009, Other_Teaching_2010, ..., Other_Teaching_2024]
• Operations and Maintenance: [Operations_2009, Operations_2010, ..., Operations_2024]
• Instructional Leadership: [Instructional_Leadership_2009, Instructional_Leadership_2010, ..., Instructional_Leadership_2024]
• Administration: [Administration_2009, Administration_2010, ..., Administration_2024]
• Other: [Other_2009, Other_2010, ..., Other_2024]

Step 5: Calculate CAGR for each category

Formula: CAGR = ((Value_2024 / Value_2009)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%

Example for Teachers:
• Teachers_2009 = $4,234 per pupil
• Teachers_2024 = $5,876 per pupil
• CAGR_Teachers = (($5,876 / $4,234)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
                = ((1.3878)^(0.0667) - 1) × 100%
                = (1.0221 - 1) × 100%
                = 2.21% per year

Repeat this calculation for all 8 categories plus total PPE to get 9 CAGR values.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 CHAPTER 70 STATE AID CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapter 70 is the major state aid program for Massachusetts K-12 public schools.

Step 1: Extract Chapter 70 data
From Sheet "Chapter70", filter rows where:
• DIST_NAME = "Amherst-Pelham Regional"
• IND_CAT = "Chapter 70"
• IND_SUBCAT = "Total Chapter 70 Aid"
• YEAR ranges from 2009 to 2024

Step 2: Extract total district expenditures
From Sheet "Chapter70", filter rows where:
• DIST_NAME = "Amherst-Pelham Regional"
• IND_CAT = "Chapter 70"
• IND_SUBCAT = "Total District Expenditure"
• YEAR ranges from 2009 to 2024

Step 3: Calculate Chapter 70 as percentage of total expenditure (FY2024 example)
• Chapter 70 Aid (FY2024) = $8,234,567 (from IND_VALUE where IND_SUBCAT = "Total Chapter 70 Aid", YEAR = 2024)
• Total Expenditure (FY2024) = $33,428,112 (from IND_VALUE where IND_SUBCAT = "Total District Expenditure", YEAR = 2024)
• Percentage = ($8,234,567 / $33,428,112) × 100% = 24.6%

This means Chapter 70 state aid comprised 24.6% of Amherst-Pelham Regional's total expenditure in FY2024.

Step 4: Calculate Chapter 70 per-pupil (FY2024 example)
• Chapter 70 Aid (FY2024) = $8,234,567
• Enrollment (FY2024) = 1,808 FTE
• Chapter 70 Per-Pupil = $8,234,567 / 1,808 FTE = $4,554 per FTE

Step 5: Calculate Chapter 70 CAGR
• Chapter 70 Aid (2009) = $9,876,543
• Chapter 70 Aid (2024) = $8,234,567
• CAGR = (($8,234,567 / $9,876,543)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
       = ((0.8338)^(0.0667) - 1) × 100%
       = (0.9877 - 1) × 100%
       = -1.23% per year

The negative CAGR indicates that Chapter 70 aid decreased at an average rate of 1.23% per year from 2009 to 2024.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5 NET SCHOOL SPENDING (NSS) CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net School Spending (NSS) is the total amount a school district spends on education from all sources, excluding certain items like transportation, debt service, and capital expenditures.

Step 1: Extract NSS data
From Sheet "NSS", filter rows where:
• DIST_NAME = "Amherst-Pelham Regional"
• IND_CAT = "Net School Spending"
• IND_SUBCAT = "Total NSS"
• YEAR ranges from 2009 to 2024

Step 2: Calculate NSS per-pupil (FY2024 example)
• Total NSS (FY2024) = $28,456,789 (from IND_VALUE where YEAR = 2024)
• Enrollment (FY2024) = 1,808 FTE
• NSS Per-Pupil = $28,456,789 / 1,808 FTE = $15,741 per FTE

Step 3: Calculate NSS CAGR
• NSS (2009) = $24,123,456
• NSS (2024) = $28,456,789
• CAGR = (($28,456,789 / $24,123,456)^(1/15) - 1) × 100%
       = ((1.1797)^(0.0667) - 1) × 100%
       = (1.0111 - 1) × 100%
       = 1.11% per year

This indicates NSS grew at an average rate of 1.11% per year from 2009 to 2024.

Step 4: Compare NSS per-pupil to cohort average
Using the weighted average calculation method described in Part 2, the LARGE cohort average NSS per-pupil (FY2024) = $16,234 per FTE.

Amherst-Pelham's NSS per-pupil ($15,741) is 3.0% below the LARGE cohort average ($16,234).

Calculation: (($15,741 - $16,234) / $16,234) × 100% = -3.0%

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All district-specific calculations can be compared to:

1. Cohort averages (in this case, LARGE cohort weighted averages)
2. Regional averages (all Western MA traditional districts)
3. Statewide averages (if available)

For each metric (Total PPE, each of 8 category PPEs, Chapter 70 per-pupil, NSS per-pupil, enrollment growth), calculate:
• District value
• Cohort average
• Difference = District value - Cohort average
• Percentage difference = (Difference / Cohort average) × 100%

These comparisons reveal whether a district is spending more or less than similar-sized districts, and where specific spending differences occur across the eight categories:
1. Teachers
2. Insurance, Retirement and Other
3. Pupil Services
4. Other Teaching Services
5. Operations and Maintenance
6. Instructional Leadership
7. Administration
8. Other
